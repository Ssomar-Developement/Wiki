# ⌨️ Commands & Permissions

On this page you will learn about Commands and Permissions of ExecutableItems plugin.

Premium features are labeled with the tag:  <CustomTag type="premium" />

## Permissions

**TIP for beginners:**

:::info
To give the permissions of all items, I advice you to download a permission plugin like [**Luckperms**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/), Once you have a perm plugin you just need to give the permission **`ei.item.*`**, for Luckperm the command is  **`/lp group default permission set ei.item.* true`**
