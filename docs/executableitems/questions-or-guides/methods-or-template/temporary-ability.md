# Temporary Ability

This page teaches you how to utilize inbuilt activator cooldowns to make sure temporary ability durations are very reliable.  
  
For this tutorial, we will make a temporary ability where the user has to press right click to enable special effects for PLAYER_HIT_ENTITY.

:::info
If you have the `ei.nocd.*` or the `*` permission, this method will malfunction.

    F["activator0 cannot put activator1 in cooldown"]

```

## Steps:

### 1) Create an EI Item

### 2) Create a PLAYER_RIGHT_CLICK activator for now

We will come back to this later.
### 3) Create 2 PLAYER_HIT_ENTITY activators

:::info
We need to take note of the activator ids of the 2 PLAYER_HIT_ENTITY activators.
:::

### 4) Go to the PLAYER_RIGHT_CLICK activator we made earlier
That is where we will add the EICOOLDOWN command.

#### Add the EICOOLDOWN command
[Click here to visit the command's page](https://docs.splugins.net/tools-for-all-plugins-score/custom-commands/player-and-target-commands#eicooldown)

We will write the command like this:
```
EICOOLDOWN %player% %id% 60 false activator1
```
For the first 2 arguments, we wrote %player% and %id% for flexibility and to make sure the item does not break if you suddenly decided to rename the id of this item and for
good practice when creating bulk amounts of similar items.

For the third argument, that will be the duration of the temporary ability. As usual, it's not going to be strictly 60 seconds. You can adjust it however you want.

For the final/5th argument, this one is important because we have to properly tell the plugin what activator to disable to avoid complications.
The activator we are trying to put in a 60 second cooldown is an activator that will prevent the next one from running, the one responsible for executing
ability functions.

### 5) Note down the id of the 3rd/last activator
![](https://media.ssomar.com/m/docs-img-temporary-ability-006.jpg)  

We need to know the id of the 3rd activator so we can put it in cooldown if the temporary ability isn't up yet.


### 6) Go to the 2nd activator and disable cooldown messages
![](https://media.ssomar.com/m/docs-img-temporary-ability-005.jpg)  

You'd really wanna disable this option because it's going to spam a LOT depending on the situation

#### Add the EICOOLDOWN to this activator
```
EICOOLDOWN %player% %id% 1 true activator2
```
We just need 1 tick of cooldown to prevent activator2 from running.

### 7) Go to the 3rd activator and disable cooldown messages

This activator gets cooldowns too due to the second activator but for this one, feel free to set cooldowns on this activator on its activator editor to edit how frequent you can trigger this temporary ability.

If you want to display the cooldown of this temporary ability, create a copy of this activator and use EICOOLDOWN to put the other activator in cooldown with the same cooldown as this one, and write the cooldown message in that other activator.

<hr/>

Now everything is set up properly! You just have to add commands to the 3rd activator to setup the temporary ability's effects.
