# RNG Chance activator

Well, well, some time ago I wanted a NINJA Armor and the idea was.. ok, some hits are dodged and some don't, but.. that "dodge" how to do it?, well, after a long time thinking this method came up, let's explain it.

:::info
This tutorial will be related to the example said above, but the idea is you to get the nutshell of the method and apply it as you want.

### Let's create the item

:::info
The **item** itself needs premium version + PlaceholderAPI + RNG Expansion

* After adding the name, lore and material..

### Let's create the activator that will make the magic

* So first, the idea is to make a RECEIVE\_HIT\_BY\_GLOBAL and cancel event.

* So now, it is cancelling EVERY received hit, to make it to sometimes cancel and sometimes doesn't cancel, we have to make the activator itself to run sometimes, so, we will add a condition related with RNG, the nutshell is, a random number between 1 and 4, if it matches 1, the activator will run, it has a probability of 25% -> that is the probability we want, let's add it.

PLAYER\_NUMBER

And in the first part we will add "%rng\_1,4%" (this require PlaceholderAPI and RNG Expansion)

EQUALS

![](<../../..//static/img/image (175).png>)

"1" (because we want it to trigger only if the random number between 1 and 4 matches 1)

And the item is ready

:::info
FOR DEBUG PURPOSES I WILL ADD THAT THE ACTIVATOR SAYS "dodge" AND IF THE PLACEHOLDER DOESN'T MATCH SAYS "didn't dodge".\
\
So once we test it, we will know if it is working properly.

And it worked, the activator only runs 1 over 4 times.

If have any question feel free to ask it in the discord of EI, have a nice day :P
