# Epic particles

In this page you will learn different methods to add particles to your item from more basic to more epic/advanced.

### 1) PARTICLE command

This command has limitations of shape, in the case of dust particle doesn't work fine, etc, that's why its not the better, you can take a look at this link

[****PARTICLE EI COMMAND****](https://docs.ssomar.com/tools-for-all-plugins/custom-commands/player-and-target-commands#particle)

### 2) Vanilla particle command

Combining this command with the tutorial of "[****how to use vanilla commands****](../frequently-asked-questions/how-to-use-vanilla-commands.md)" you will get something like

```
execute at <placeholder> run particle....
```

Here you are more free than the last one, but again, the shape is only a parallelepiped, not the most epic thing.

If don't know how to use particle command take a look at this link

[****Particle command generator****](https://www.gamergeeks.net/apps/minecraft/particle-command-generator)

### 3) Particle generators

Here you will have some webpages to generate particle shapes, these are SO useful to create stuff.

Most of them works based on math equations, so you need a little of preknowledge of this. To take a look at how math equations work you can use GEOGEBRA

To extract the commands from one line or from a function to commands divided you need some pre-knowledge too.

The [****first link****](https://100awesome.net/videos/particle-generator/) is a particle generator based on one command block, you have a video tutorial too

The [****second link****](https://cloudwolfyt.github.io/pages/gens/particle-plots.html) is better, it works with math equations so you can get lot of more shapes than the last one. There is also a [****video link****](https://youtu.be/\_mi1B0IeVWw).

### 4) Score particles

There is also Score particles who includes lot of pre-made shapes that you can edit with their specific parameters to display what you'd like to display. More info in the tutorial of [****Score particles****](../../../tools-for-all-plugins-score/score-particles.md).
