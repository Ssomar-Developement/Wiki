## Disable enableTexturesPack

Set the value to false

## If it fails, disable selfHostPack

Normally, the option above does the job, but if its not enough, disable this too.

## If it fails, delete the pack folder inside the `__textures__` folder.

There are cases where even disabling `selfHostPack` isn't enough. THIS should finally solve the issue

## Still fails? Go to the support discord

Because this isn't normal anymore. We are fairly active there so you should be able to receive a response within 24 hours.
