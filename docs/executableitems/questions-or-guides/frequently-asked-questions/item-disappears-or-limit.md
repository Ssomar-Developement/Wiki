### Make the item disappear after "x" uses

* If this is the case, let's say we want to set that our item can only be used 10 times, we should go to the main GUI Editor.
* ![](</img/image (107).png>)
* And click on the bucket of "Usage"
* ![](</img/image (377).png>)
* Remember we want the item to disappear after 10 times the activator we created triggers, so we will set this value to "10"
* ![](</img/image (320).png>)
* And that's it.

### Make the item NOT disappear.

* In this case, we would like our item to trigger the activator infinite times without the item disappearing, so we have to go to the main GUI Editor.
* ![](</img/image (123).png>)
* And click on the bucket of "Usage"
* ![](</img/image (390).png>)
* And set this value to "-1"
* ![](</img/image (124).png>)
* Once did that, the item won't disappear after triggering the activator.
