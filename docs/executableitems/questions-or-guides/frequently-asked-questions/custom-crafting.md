# Custom Crafting

## Does ExecutableItems Support Custom Crafting?

ExecutableItems does **not** have built-in custom crafting mechanics. To create custom recipes for ExecutableItems, you need to use a third-party custom crafting plugin.

You can use our plugin [ExecutableCrafting](https://modrinth.com/plugin/executablecrafting)
But if you want to use another you can, generally they are compatible with ExecutableItems.
