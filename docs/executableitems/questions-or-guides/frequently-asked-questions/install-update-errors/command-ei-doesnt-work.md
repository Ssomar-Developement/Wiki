# command /ei doesn't work

If you do, for example `/ei show` and doesn't work, the first thing you should do is try to do `/executableitems:ei show`

* If it works now, well, the problem is another plugin is overriding the command /ei, an example of this is Essentials, so from now, you can either disable /ei on the plugin who overrides the command, or do /executableitems:ei all the time you want to use a command from ExecutableItems
* And, if it didn't work, is because the plugin is not installed correctly and you should either check the [**Installation tutorial**](how-to-install-correctly.md) or the [**common errors on logs**](installation-errors-logs.md)
