# Plugin doesn't work 😡😡

If you think something is not working as intended, or there is a bug, and you already:

* 😀 Installed it correctly following the Installation procedure

* 📃 Checked the logs file to see if there is an error, and if there is an error checked the way to solve it in the wiki.

* ✅ Downloaded and installed the last version of the plugin
* ⭐ And tested with only EI and Score to see if there is an incompatibility with other plugin

As much as possible, install the latest version of a major update\
Ex: instead of using 1.20, use 1.20.2
