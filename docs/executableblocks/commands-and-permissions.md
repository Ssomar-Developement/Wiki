# ⌨️ Commands & Permissions

## Permissions

**TIP for beginners:**

:::info
To give the permissions of all items, I advice you to download a permission plugin like [**Luckperms**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/), Once you have a perm plugin you just need to give the permission **`eb.block.*`**, for Luckperm the command is  **`/lp group default permission set eb.block.* true`**
