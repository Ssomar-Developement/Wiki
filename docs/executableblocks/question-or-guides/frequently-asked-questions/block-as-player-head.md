# Block as player head

* If you'd like your ExecutableBlock to be a player head you need to first:
* Create an EI Item (ExecutableItem) /ei create \<id>
  * ![](<../../..//static/img/image (346).png>)
  * Set the material to PLAYER\_HEAD
  * Use the features related to it to add a texture to it (link below)
  *

      

\{% embed url="https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/item-configuration/item-features#head-settings" %\}

* And once the EI Item is ready, create your EB Block. And inside the MAIN GUI
* 
* On CreationType select IMPORT\_FROM\_EXECUTABLE\_ITEMS
* ![](<../../..//static/img/image (365).png>)
* And select the EI you created
*

    
* Then save and that's it, now your EB is a custom texture PLAYER\_HEAD
