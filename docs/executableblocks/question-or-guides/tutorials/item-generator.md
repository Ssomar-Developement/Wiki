# Item generator

This item can be done using the premium version of the plugin

* Create the eb with /eb create \<id>
* Select the material, a title if you want, etc
* Then create an activator LOOP
* ![](<../../..//static/img/image (257).png>)
* Then in commands we can use either DROPITEM or DROPEXECUTABLEITEM.
* ![](<../../..//static/img/image (161).png>)
* And I will set the delay of the LOOP to 3 seconds (so 3 emeralds will be dropped each 3 seconds)

And that's it, the generator is done.
