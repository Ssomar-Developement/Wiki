# Player & Target Commands

:::warning
You need to know that by default all commands are run by the console, so if you want that the player run the command add [**SUDO**](player-and-target-commands.md#sudo) or [**SUDO\_OP**](player-and-target-commands.md#sudo_op) before. 

_(Click on SUDO or SUDO\_OP for more infos)_

\
**Don't use this option for vanilla commands and CUSTOM COMMANDS, to use vanilla commands properly go to FAQ and "How to use vanilla commands",**
:::

:::tip
"Multi-world" compatibility for the vanilla commands.

`execute in <<NAME`_`OF`_`YOUR_WORLD>> run ...`

Example, you want summon a Zombie in the world SsomarWorld:

`execute in <<SsomarWorld>> run summon zombie 100 50 100`

Example with a placeholder`:`

`execute in <<%player_world%>> run summon zombie 100 50 100`
:::

:::info
You want keep the brut HEX form in your command ? add the tag **BRUT\_HEX** in your command. It works anywhere in the command line but it's recommended to put it in the first part of the cmd to make it less confusing
:::

:::info
By default all commands aren't executed if the player is offline. (the commands will be executed at the connection of the player)

But you can add the tag **\[\<OFFLINE>]** in your commands to remove this restriction.

_(Very useful for broadcast, boost, giveall commands, ...)_

Example:

* \[\<OFFLINE>] broadcast hello !
* \[\<OFFLINE>] execute at %player% run setblock %block\_x\_int%+3 %block\_y\_int%-1 %block\_z\_int%-14 minecraft:air
:::

:::info
You can use \[\<CLEAR\_IF\_DISCONNECT>] if you want to clear commands if the player disconnects

Example:

* \[\<CLEAR\_IF\_DISCONNECT>] say meow
