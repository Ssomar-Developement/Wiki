# Utility Commands

If you edit the commands in-game don't add the **-** that is before all examples.

### DELAY

* Info: Delays a command line for seconds
* Command settings:
  * `{amount}`: To how long you want commands to be delayed (In seconds)
* Example:

```yaml
activators:**
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands: #There will be a delay of 10 seconds between the command1 and the command2.
**    - command1**
    - DELAY 10
    - command2
```

### DELAY\_TICK

* Info: Delays a command line for game ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)
* Command settings:
  * `{amount}`: To how long you want commands to be delayed (In ticks)
* Example:

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - command1
    - DELAY_TICK 5 # (0.25 seconds)
    - command2
```

## **IF**

:::info
CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS IN PLAYER RELATED AND ENTITY RELATED COMMANDS
:::

* Info: Executes commands if condition is met
* Command settings:
  * `{condition_without_spaces}`: The condition for the IF to decide whether it runs or not.
    * Symbols: `=`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`
    * It supports () for priority , && for AND and || for OR
  * `{command1}`,`{command2}`: The commands that will be executed
* Example:

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - IF %player_health%>20 say cool
```

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - IF %entity%=PIG say I'm a pig <+> SETBABY <+> say I'm now a baby pig
```

```yaml
activators:**
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - IF 1=1||2=3 BACKDASH 1 # 1=1 OR 2=3 -> YES because 1=1
    - IF 1=1&#x26;&#x26;2=2||2=3 BACKDASH 1 # 1=1 and 2=2 or 2=3 -> YES because 1=1 and 2=2
    - IF (1=1&#x26;&#x26;2=2)||(2=3||3=2) BACKDASH 1 # (1=1 and 2=2) or (2=3 or 3=2) -> YES because 1=1 and 2=2
```

## **WHILE**

* Info: Repeats indefinitely as long as the condition is met. It is also running in async
* Command settings:
  * `{condition_without_spaces}`: The condition for the while loop to decide whether it continues or stops
  * `{delay_in_ticks}`: The delay before the next repetition
    * Delay supports decimals value but they are casted to the next integer (20.1 -> 20)
  * `{command}`,`{command2}`: The commands that will be executed in repeat
* Example:

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - WHILE %player_health%>10 20 SEND_MESSAGE &eHello &6While <+> minecraft:effect give %player% speed 1 1
```

:::info
It runs async + Condition support double placeholders, example %player\_x%>%player\_z%
:::

:::info
The command will be stopped if the player is offline
:::

## LOOP

* LOOP\_START
  * Info: First part of the command
  * Command settings:
    * `{number}`: Number of times a command gets repeated. Placeholders are supported
* LOOP\_END
  * Info: Last part of the command
  * No settings required
* Example: (This is what you will see on config)

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - 'LOOP_START loopCount:5' # (50%)
    - SEND_MESSAGE &cYOU GOT AN APPLE! +++ minecraft:give %player% apple 1
    - LOOP_END
    - 'LOOP_START loopCount:3' # (30%)
    - SEND_MESSAGE &7YOU GOT IRON! +++ minecraft:give %player% iron_ingot 1
    - LOOP_END
    - 'LOOP_START loopCount:2' # (20%)
    - SEND_MESSAGE &aYOU GOT DIAMOND! +++ minecraft:give %player% diamond 1
    - LOOP_END
    - RANDOM_END
```

This is what the ExecutableItems plugin sees when it runs

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - SEND_MESSAGE &cYOU GOT AN APPLE! +++ minecraft:give %player% apple 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &cYOU GOT AN APPLE! +++ minecraft:give %player% apple 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &cYOU GOT AN APPLE! +++ minecraft:give %player% apple 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &cYOU GOT AN APPLE! +++ minecraft:give %player% apple 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &cYOU GOT AN APPLE! +++ minecraft:give %player% apple 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &7YOU GOT IRON! +++ minecraft:give %player% iron_ingot 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &7YOU GOT IRON! +++ minecraft:give %player% iron_ingot 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &7YOU GOT IRON! +++ minecraft:give %player% iron_ingot 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &aYOU GOT DIAMOND! +++ minecraft:give %player% diamond 1
    - SEND_MESSAGE &aYOU GOT DIAMOND! +++ minecraft:give %player% diamond 1
    - RANDOM_END
```

Explanation:

When the plugin runs the commands, it duplicates the commands inside the loop commands to reduce the number of command lines in your config to make your config cleaner and since RANDOM\_RUN gives each command equal rates, the estimated rate will be:

* 50% chance to get an apple
* 30% chance to get iron
* 20% chance to get diamond

## FOR - END\_FOR

* Command that allows you to target multiple elements inside a list

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - FOR [Special70, Ssomar, Vayk] > for1
    - effect give %for1% speed 60 2
    - END_FOR for1
```

:::info
What exactly happened here is that the FOR command will run 3 times because inside the bracket symbols, there are 3 values which are `Special70`, `Ssomar` and `Vayk`.

The `for1` word will be used as an "identifier" for that FOR command so we can use the placeholder for it. 

So when the effect command runs for the first time, %for1% will return "\
Special70" then "Ssomar" for the second and "Vayk" for the third time.

Don't overthink about the `>` symbol.
:::

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - FOR [Special70, Ssomar, Vayk] > for2
    - FOR [5,4,3,2,1] > for3
    - SEND_MESSAGE >> &e%for2% &a%for3%
    - END_FOR for3
    - END_FOR for2
```

:::info
What exactly happened here is that the FOR loops got stacked so the first FOR command will run the commands in it which is another FOR command that will run 5 times.

If you're gonna focus on the SEND\_MESSAGE command, the reason it ran 15 times because the first FOR command executed what's inside it by 3 while the second FOR command executed the SEND\_MESSAGE command 5 times which totals 15 times.

:::info
**It works with score variable list placeholders**
:::

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - FOR %score_variables_myList% > for4
    - minecraft:effect give %for4% speed 60 2
    - END_FOR for4
```

## Run commands randomly ?

[https://youtu.be/jXTDlqoE8dc](https://youtu.be/jXTDlqoE8dc)

### RANDOM\_RUN / RANDOM\_END

* Info: A command mainly used for RNG.
* RANDOM\_RUN
  * Info: The first part of the command
  * Command: RANDOM\_RUN selectionCount:\{amount\}
    * selectionCount: The amount of commands that will be randomly selected inside of the command line. Placeholders are supported
* RANDOM\_END
  * Info: The other part of the command
  * Command: RANDOM\_END

:::tip
**To be able to run multiple commands in one command line inside the RANDOM part use `+++`**
:::

* Example:

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - minecraft:give %player% coal 1
    - minecraft:give %player% iron_ingot 1
    - minecraft:give %player% gold_ingot 1
    - RANDOM_END
```

This means that you have a 1/3 chance of getting coal, iron or gold

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:2'
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond 1 +++ SEND_MESSAGE &aYou receive &b1 Diamond
    - minecraft:give %player% emerald 1 +++ SEND_MESSAGE &aYou receive &21 Emerald
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond_block 1 +++ SEND_MESSAGE &aYou receive &b1 Diamond block
    - RANDOM_END
```

This means that from the 3 give commands, 2 of the randomly chosen command lines will run.

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - NOTHING*9
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond_block 1
    - RANDOM_END
```

This means that there's a 10% chance to give you a diamond block.

:::info
NOTHING is just a command to adjust y percentage and if you want a case where the RNG will do nothing.
:::

:::info
It supports placeholders

### NOTHING*

* Info: Mainly used for RANDOM\_RUN commands as a "dummy" command for RNG adjustments
* Command settings:
  * `{amount}`: Number of dummy commands to generate
* Example of usage:

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - NOTHING*99
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond 1
    - RANDOM_END
```

This command line means that there is a 1/100 chance it will give you a diamond

### More Examples:

1. I want to make it so 99% chance it will give me dirt and 1% chance to give me diamond BUT I don't want to write 99 lines of the give dirt command.

* So here is how to do it.

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'LOOP_START loopCount:99' 
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - LOOP_END
```

* The 99 represents that any commands inside the loop command will be duplicated 99 times. You will only see the give command and the loop command but the plugin sees 99 give commands.
* Here is what the plugin sees

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1
```

(You get the idea.)

* So let's go back to our main objective. 99% chance to get dirt, 1% chance to get diamond. The RANDOM\_RUN command evenly gives the same RNG rates to all the commands inside the RANDOM\_RUN command.

:::warning
The (5%) percentage stuff is not part of the command. It's written here in the wiki for you to acknowledge the chances for that command to be selected from the list of commands
:::

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt #(1/2 = 50%)
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond #(1/2 = 50%)
    - RANDOM_END
```

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt #(1/3 = 33%)
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond #(1/3 = 33%)
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond #(1/3 = 33%)
    - RANDOM_END
```

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt #(1/4 = 25%)
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt #(1/4 = 25%)
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond #(1/4 = 25%)
    - NOTHING*1 #(1/4 = 25%)
    - RANDOM_END
```

* After seeing these RANDOM\_RUN examples, we will acknowledge that it would work like this.

```yaml
activators:
  activator0: # Activator ID, you can create as many activator on the activators list
    commands:
    - 'RANDOM_RUN selectionCount:1'
    - 'LOOP_START loopCount:99' 
    - minecraft:give %player% dirt 1  #(99/100 = 99%)
    - LOOP_END
    - minecraft:give %player% diamond 1 #(1/100 = 1%)
    - RANDOM_END
```

* The total of the supposed lines is 100 so it's going to be (100 command lines / 100% = 1%) rate per command.
