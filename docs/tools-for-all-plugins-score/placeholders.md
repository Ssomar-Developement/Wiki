# ðŸ“š Placeholders

:::tip
All numerical placeholders can be incremented or decremented.

* Example : `%amount%+6` (Increase)
  * %amount% = 15
  * %amount% + 6 =
  * (15) + 6 = 21
* Example : `%amount%-8` (Decrease)
  * %amount% = 14
  * %amount% - 8 =
  * (14) - 8 = 6 
:::

:::tip
But you can also you the [math placeholders](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders#math) of [PlaceholderAP](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)I

* EI placeholders are parsed first before PlaceholderAPI placeholders are parsed.
* Examples of using an EI placeholder inside of a math placeholder
  * `%math_0_(%usage%)*10%`
* EI placeholders are pre-parsed and any placeholders that are not ei are parsed upon command activation so you can use ei placeholders for xyz coordinates and not worry about change in values
:::

:::warning
If %around\_target% ever fails to properly return the AROUND/MOB\_AROUND around target's details, use **%around\_target::step1%**
:::

## Miscellaneous Placeholders

:::info
%activator\_id% : Returns the id of the activator. \
Can be found at:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (438).png>)\
%activator\_name% : Returns the name of the activator that's listed at the DisplayName field of the activator editor
:::

:::info
%rand:MIN\_VALUE|MAX\_VALUE% : Randomizer value

* Example : `%rand:10|100%` - Generates a number between 10-100
* Supports negative value | MIN\_VALUE must be < than MAX\_VALUE
:::

:::warning
Even if there are multiple %rand:MIN\_VALUE|MAX\_VALUE% placeholders in a command line, it would still give the same number so if you want a rng placeholder that would give different answers for every of its placeholder that exists in the command line, use PlaceholderAPI's RNG Expansion
:::

:::info
%timestamp% -> gets the current time
:::

:::info
%score\_cooldown\_\{plugin\}:\{object\_id\}:\{activator\_id\}% -> gets the cooldown, it works for all plugins.\
\
Examples:

* %score\_cooldown\_EI:Free\_Lotery:activator1%
* %score\_cooldown\_EI:cybert1:activator6\_int%

## Player placeholders

| Placeholder | Description | **%player%** | Name of the player. Can be used to display the owner of the item in the item's lore | **%player_uuid%** | UUID of the player (%player_uuid_array% for its 4-array integer form.

This is used to calculate damage, with 1.0 representing a fully charged attack and 0.0 representing a non-charged attack (1.16+ only)<br /><br />This placeholder gets reset after a DAMAGE command, so if you want to debug it, display the value before a DAMAGE command. 

### Initial Player Placeholders

The significance of these placeholders is for people who want to create advanced configurations that require the user's values when the activator gets triggered while expecting them to not change as the commands execute.

```
%player_world_initial%
%player_world_lower_initial%
%player_direction_initial%
%player_x_initial%
%player_y_initial%
%player_z_initial%
%player_x_initial_int%
%player_y_initial_int%
%player_z_initial_int%
%player_pitch_initial%
%player_pitch_positive_initial%
%player_pitch_initial_int%
%player_pitch_positive_initial_int%
%player_yaw_initial%
%player_yaw_positive_initial%
%player_yaw_initial_int%
%player_yaw_positive_initial_int%
```

## Target player placeholders

(The activator must have a target player)

Its the same placeholders that the **PLAYER PLACEHOLDERS** abov&#x65;**,** just replace "player" by "target".

Example:

`%target_x%`

| Placeholder                                                          | Description                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| <p>%target_last_damage_taken% <br />%target_last_damage_taken_int%</p> | The last damage taken by the target |

## Entity placeholders

(The activator must have an entity) 

* in EI / EB it's always these placeholders for entity.
* in EE it's quite different, since we can have an entity as a main actor of the event but also as target. So use these placeholders below when the entity is the main actor of the event. And Look the part **Target entity placeholders** when the entity is the target.

| Placeholder | Description | **%entity%** | Type of the entity | **%entity_lower_case%** | Type of the entity in lower case | **%entity_name%** | Name of the entity (lower case: **%entity_name_lower_case%**) | **%entity_uuid%** | UUID of the entity (%entity_uuid_array% for its 4-array integer form.

Example: `%target_x%`

## Block placeholders

(The activator must have a block)

* in EI / EB it's always these placeholders for entity.
* in EE it's quite different, since we can have a block as a main actor of the event but also as target. So use these placeholders below when the block is the main actor of the event. And Look the part **Target block placeholders** when the block is the target.

| Placeholder | Description | **%block%** | Type of the block when the activator has been activated (In caps) | **%block_lower%** | Type of the block when the activator has been activated (In lower case) | **%block_live%** | Current type of the block (In caps) | **%block_item_material%** | Return the item material of the block for example the block CARROTS return CARROT, for lower cases use **%block_item_material_lower%** | **%block_live_lower%** | Current type of the block (In lower case) | **%block_x%** | X-Coordinates of the block (USE **%block_x_int%** to get the block coordinates without decimals) | **%block_y%** | Y-Coordinates of the block (USE **%block_y_int%** to get the block coordinates without decimals) | **%block_z%** | Z-Coordinates of the block (USE **%block_z_int%** to get the block coordinates without decimals) | **%blockface%** | Returns the face of the selected block. | **%block_data%** | Returns the data of the block | **%block_world%** | The name of the world where the block is located (**%block_world_lower%** for lower) Use &#x3C;&#x3C;%block_world%>> when entering world argument in vanilla commands | %block_biome% | <p>The name of the biome where the block is located</p><p>List of all biomes <a href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html">here</a></p><p>(**%block_biome_lower%** for lower)</p> | **%block_dimension%** | The type of world (nether, custom, normal, end) | **%block_spawnertype%** | Returns the type of mob in spawner or "null" | **%block_is_ageable%** | Returns if the block is ageable or not | **%block_eb_id%** | If the block is an ExecutableBlock then it returns its ID otherwise it return an empty text. 

## Target block placeholders

(Will work only if an owner is set for the block / item)

Its the same placeholders that the **PLAYER PLACEHOLDERS** abov&#x65;**,** just replace "player" by "owner".

Example: `%owner_health%SC`

***

## Variables placeholders

Here you can take a look at the internal item/block variable types and their placeholders. This type of variables are not the same as "score variables", these variables are independent for each item/block, and score variables are variables not linked to an item or a block.

### Variable Placeholders - Internal item/block 

(Placeholders that you can use if you have a variable)

**Example if your variable is named: X**

| Placeholder         | Description                                |
