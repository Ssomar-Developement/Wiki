# Block Conditions

## Condition settings
All conditions are formated the same, you have:
* `{theCondition}`
* `{theCondition}Msg`: The message to send if the condition is invalid
* `{theCondition}Cancel`: Whether or not the event should be cancelled if the condition is invalid
* `{theCondition}Cmds`: The command(s) to run if the condition is invalid
* Example:

```yaml
blockConditions:
     ifBlockAge: <2
     ifBlockAgeMsg: "héhéhé you can custom your message here"
     ifBlockAgeCancel: true
     ifBlockAgeCmds:
     - say how sad
```

:::info
For numerical conditions, you can assign 2 conditions at the same time.
Example: 
"I want to create a condition that only activates if the value is greater than 50 but less than 250"
`{theCondition}: 50 < CONDITION < 250`

Don't use that in an activator very frenquetly used because it will require a lot of performances

          errorMsg: '&#x26;c&#x26;oA block is not placed correctly !'

          - EXECUTABLEBLOCKS:CUSTOMDIRT
          - !DIRT
          - ALL_ORES
```

```yaml
blockConditions:**
      requiredItems: \{\}
      requiredExecutableItems: \{\}
      blockAroundCdts:
        blockAround0:
          southValue: 0
          northValue: 0
          westValue: 0
          eastValue: 0

          - stone
          placeholdersConditions:
            plchCdt0:

              messageIfNotValidForTarget: ''
              stopCheckingOtherConditionsIfNotValid: true
              placeholderConditionCmds:
              - say not run
```

Q: What exactly is going on in placeholder conditions?\
A: The placeholder %var\_x% is being parsed according to the block in that position. Meaning, you can use this method to assign a specific number to insane amount of unique EBs without writing each id that may change overtime in blockTypeMustBe
