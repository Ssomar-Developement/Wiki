# Server chat spamming

## First type of spam

First of all we have to explain that inside the activator you create for your ExecutableBlocks, in the commands section, as long as the command you write isn't one of the Custom Commands of EI, it will be run by the console, so, if its the case you use a vanilla command, such as:

* execute...
* effect give...
* particle...
* playsound....
* etc

The server will output in your chat what you are doing and will look like this:

![\[Server: \<action>\]](</img/image (150).png>)

If you want to disable this, you have to **set broadcast-console-to-ops to false in your server.properties file.**

:::info
The file "server.properties" is in inside the server folder.
:::

:::danger
****broadcast-console-to-ops**** IS NOT THE SAME THAN **broadcast-rcon-to-ops**

## Second type of spam

If you are having the type of spam that looks in the photo, is because you are using SUDOOP command, **don't use it.**

:::tip
Check FAQ -> How to use vanilla commands and use the commands correctly.
