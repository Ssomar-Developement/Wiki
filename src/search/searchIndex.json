Well, in the premium version you can create as many blocks as you want, there is no limit, and also.. as a tip, since you will have a lot of blocks, wouldn't be a bad idea organizing them in folders. üòé Activators In the free version you can only work with \\~10 activators , but there are +25 activators to make your items in the premium version , so you could trigger a block of commands depending on almost every action the player does. Besides you will unlock every activator, you will also unlock the possibility to have as many activators as you want per block , that means creating multi functional blocks, that does a lot of abilities, mechanics and complex constructor of skills. All features There are some features that grants a whole different view about how the blocks, activators, and triggering skills works, ¬øproblem with free one? most of them are disabled in the free version. Premium support You would think.. hey, is there a difference in premium support and free support? generally no. ¬øSo why is this option as a pro of buying the premium version if its the same? well.. once you buy the premium version, a world of features is unlocked, and with that, the possibility to create super complex blocks, that means that your questions mostly will get difficult to answer, answers that not a lot of people will be able to answer. For example, free version questions are relative easily to answer, since you have limitations, the questions are common and get repeated, so helpers and even people that peeks the channel and want to help will be able to help you. But with premium stuff.. sometimes the questions that are asked needs a lot of works, opening threads to only speak there, complex mechanics explanations, and that's why the helpers are there, they will be able 99% of times to help you with almost everything, you ask something, and they will figure out how would it be possible, sometimes the way are easier and sometimes harder, but we will guide you to a safe road. Pre-made blocks Once you got premium, if you haven't spend lot of time using the free one, you will not know how to work with it, so either you learn reading the tutorials in the wiki, the common questions, or taking a look at - pre-made blocks: In the default blocks there are a lots of blocks that needs premium and are cool, looking how they work with free version doesn't make sense, but once you have premium, feel free to open it and see how it works, why it has \"x\" amount of activators, oh, \" this happens.. and then this \".. There is a discord channel and also a webpage where there are also lots of blocks shared by people, for obvious reasons, most of them are premium, once you got it, the same with the previous one, you will be able to check how they work, or just use them to your server without modifying anything.. as you want And last but not less important, the blocks made by helpers, sometimes when people ask about blocks, depending on the complexity / what the asker wants / available time , it is possible for us to instead of explaining how to make \"...\", we can make it for you, and obviously, that config will be shared in the premium channel in Discord, that means.. there are more than 3000 files sent in the channel, so, with the WIKI and with the searchbar of Discord, you will be able to search almost anything.. (and obviously, if you don't find it, feel free to ask ^^) Support our work Ssomar, developer of all these plugins, have taken a lot of time to develop this plugin bringing you all this time ALL-IN-GUI menu to add every possible feature, Fix all the bugs reported in suggestion-bugs fastest as possible, adding the suggestions that people would like to see in the plugin, and he still doing it until today. Supporters, Special70, Vayk and Ssomar too (unstoppable ), answer every question asked in the supports channels (even if they are already asked in the wiki ü§®ü§® , we link you there), studying the possibilities of the plugin, knowing how it works, spending a lot of time into developing to get better and better, and with that, get a best experience to answer your questions. Also the answer wait time is crazy, looks like a race üöó, we are always attentive to new messages, so, your message will not leave there alone days until someone answers, you will literally be answered as fast as we can. üí™ Anyways, the fact is that there is a lot of hard work behind, with acquiring the premium version you, and your server, will win in terms of features and also you will support all our hard work behind of it all this time. :::info If have any question related with premium version feel free to ask it in the support channel of Ssomar plugin's Discord. :::",

To avoid this you have to add \" execute at %player% run \" before the command, that will force the command to be run from the coordinates where the player is. For example: ‚úÖexecute at %player% run summon tnt ~ ~ ~ ‚ùåplaysound minecraft:ambient.cave master %player% ~ ~ ~ 1 1 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run playsound minecraft:ambient.cave master %player% ~ ~ ~ 1 1 ‚ùåparticle minecraft:flame ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 0 10 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run particle minecraft:flame ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 0 10 ‚úÖeffect give %player% speed 15 1 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run setblock ~ ~ ~ stone ‚úÖexecute at %player% run fill ~1 ~1 ~1 ~-1 ~-1 ~-1 stone replace air ‚úÖexecute at %player% run tellraw %player% \\{\"text\":\"hi\"\\} ‚úÖexecute at %player% run tellraw @a \\{\"text\":\"hi\"\\} These are special exceptions, that means, placeholders or general stuff that only works by certain conditions.

Type of server First of all keep in mind that the plugin is a spigot coded plugin, so it needs a server based on it, such as: Spigot Paper Purpur Etc (Any fork of spigot) :::danger For example, Bukkit isn't compatible, it has to be BukkitSpigot. ::: Type of hosting The hosting must allow the owner to import files, if the host doesn't allow that, such as using only the plugins available in a list of the hosting, ExecutableBlocks can't be used. :::danger There are Hostings that allows you to install quickly some plugins that are downloaded in their clouds, in the case of ExecutableBlocks don't use them, most of them don't work properly, its better to install it with the normal method of importing files. ::: Versions of Minecraft These are the versions supported by ExecutableBlocks: Correct way of installing 1. Download the plugin from spigot 2. You get a file .zip (this is like a folder, you have to open it using Winrar) 3. You open it and you see that there are 2 files inside, ExecutableBlocks.jar and Score.jar , both of them are needed 4. Pick up both plugins and drag them into plugins folder. (the zip is nothing so don't drag that file into plugins folder, you only need the two plugins inside the jar) :::warning If its the case you are using a webpage host server, it is highly recommended to don't drop it instantly into plugins folder , but, drag them first into desktop and once they are in your desktop, drag them into plugins folder. ::: Once done, you can start your server. :::info It is highly suggested to install it with a reload of the server (stop+start) and not with plugins managers. ::: Special cases If its the case you have ExecutableItems or ExecutableBlocks in your server, once downloading one you should update the current one. For example, I want to install ExecutableItems, while doing, I should update ExecutableBlocks too. :::info This is just for keep both plugins in the same versions (otherwise it can bring problems) ::: Still not working In case you got all the information said before, doing the right things and the plugin still not working, feel free to ask in the Discord and we will help you. :::info Also what you can do, that is something that have fixed some problems on people's threads related to the plugin not working, is downloading the plugin again and installing it again.

Type of server First of all keep in mind that the plugin is a spigot coded plugin, so it needs a server based on it, such as: Spigot Paper Purpur Etc (Any fork of spigot) :::danger For example, Bukkit isn't compatible, it has to be BukkitSpigot. ::: Type of hosting The hosting must allow the owner to import files, if the host doesn't allow that, such as using only the plugins available in a list of the hosting, ExecutableCrafting can't be used. :::danger There are Hostings that allows you to install quickly some plugins that are downloaded in their clouds, in the case of ExecutableCrafting don't use them, most of them don't work properly, its better to install it with the normal method of importing files. ::: Versions of Minecraft These are the versions supported by ExecutableCrafting. Free version from 1.16 to 1.21.5+ (More information in MC Versions Compatibility ) Correct way of installing 1. Download the plugin (Links are available on the page bellow) You get .jar If you only get ExecutableItems.jar, you will need to download also the SCore jar (our lib plugin). You can find it on Modrinth Pick up both plugins jar and drag them into plugins folder. You get a .zip You get a file .zip (this is like a folder, you have to open it using Winrar) You open it and you see that there are 2 files inside, ExecutableItems.jar and Score.jar , both of them are needed Pick up both plugins jar and drag them into plugins folder. (the zip is nothing so don't drag that file into plugins folder, you only need the two plugins inside the jar) :::warning If its the case you are using a webpage host server, it is highly recommended to don't drop it instantly into plugins folder , but, drag them first into desktop and once they are in your desktop, drag them into plugins folder. ::: Once done, you can start your server. :::info It is highly suggested to install it with a reload of the server (stop+start) and not with plugins managers. ::: Special cases If its the case you have ExecutableItems or ExecutableBlocks in your server, once downloading one you should update the current one. For example, I want to install ExecutableItems, while doing, I should update ExecutableBlocks too. :::info This is just for keep both plugins in the same versions (otherwise it can bring problems) ::: Still not working In case you got all the information said before, doing the right things and the plugin still not working, feel free to ask in the Discord and we will help you. :::info Also what you can do, that is something that have fixed some problems on people's threads related to the plugin not working, is downloading the plugin again and installing it again. It is weird, it is not our fault, but sometimes just doing the steps again fixes it, nobody knows why, its like a law of life, you could give it a try :P :::",

      "content": "Activators features All this features are inside the activator, as reminder the activators allow you to execute custom actions on your ExecutableItem, it can have conditions, run commands, have cooldown, etc. Starred features ‚≠ê are for premium version. General features of an activator Display name of the activator Info: String value of the display name of the activator, it doesn't have much use, its used for the developer to recognize one activator from another. It also appears on the default message \"timeLeft\" inside the locale.yml file. Example: Variables modification Info: Its a list of variables modification to apply to the variables inside your item. Its useful for example, for increase the value of a variable, for overriding an old value of a variable to another value, etc. variableName: Name of the variable the variableModification is targetting type: Type of variableModification you are using SET: Override the old value of the variable and sets the modification value. ADD: Apply math to the current value of the variable using the modification value. It needs the variable to be type of NUMBER. If the modification value is positive then it will increase, if its negative then it will decrease. LIST\\ ADD: Applied to variable type LIST, it appens the modification value to the variable list. LIST\\ CLEAR: Applied to variable type LIST, it clears the variable list. LIST\\ REMOVE: Applied to variable type LIST, it removes the modification value from the variable list. modification: Value of modification. Its applied to the variable using the types of modifications. Example: Be careful when using placeholders here There is no problem with that, just make sure the returning output is a NUMBER, otherwise you will need to use STRING features. For example, let's update a variableModification by another variable that we know it returns a NUMBER. cancelEvent Info: Boolean value that represents if the event related to the activator is going to be cancelled or not. This can be hard to understand, I think its one of the things that most people don't understand but to explain it you must know that each ACTIVATOR is related to a Minecraft event, following the idea this event occur and then the ACTIVATOR is triggered. if we enabling cancelEvent which is a feature from the activator, that means the event occur, then at almost the same time the activator gets triggered and it cancels the event, so the activator keeps running all its enabled features but the event didn't happen, cancelling it. For example: If the activator is PLAYER\\ HIT\\ PLAYER and we enable cancelEvent then the player won't be able to hit the player due all hits are cancelled/ignored. If the activator is PLAYER\\ BLOCK\\ BREAK and we enable cancelEvent then the player won't be able to break blocks due the event is cancelled/ignored. Example: worldConditions Info: You can use this conditions in all type of activators World conditions placeholdersConditions Info: You can use this conditions in all type of activators PlaceholdersConditions silenceOutput Info: Boolean value that makes all commands run from commands features such as (playerCommands, blockCommands, entityCommands and targetCommands) will not have an output on the console . For example, using the minecraft vanilla command effect give \\ ... normally has an output on the console with this format: \"Applied effect strength to \\ \", well, to disable this output you can enable this feature Example: Its important to understand that this feature is made to disable vanilla commands output, if you use another plugin command and it has a console output, its not our side who should fix it, the other plugin should provide you a way to hide those messages. Anyways, because we are gentle you have a way to customize messages from being hidden so you can have the default messages silenced by silenceOutput + custom messages you would like to add. This process is handled by Score config file more information here and how to do it here https://docs.ssomar.com/tools-for-all-plugins-score/score/general-config . ‚≠êRequired features This section is for setting up features related to required things in order to be able to trigger the activator. This means that if the event happens, the activator will only run if the player matches this required setup. The items will be consumed in the process. If you would like the items not to get consumed then not use \"required\" feature but use conditions which are just conditions and doesn't consume. ‚≠êrequiredExecutableItems Info: This feature allows the activator to have as requirement an ExecutableItem(s). If the player meets this requirement the requirement will be consumed and the activator will run. cancelEventIfError: Boolean value that represents if the event will be cancelled if the player doesn't have the requirement. This means, for example, let's say there is an event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, and it occurs but the player doesn't have the requirements in order to trigger the activator, if this feature is enabled the event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled so the player even though its clicking/hit the entity, the entity is not getting damage because in reality the event is not occurring due its being cancelled. errorMessage: String message that will be sent to the player if the player doesn't meet the requirement. executableItem: ExecutableItem ID that is needed as requiremennt amount: Integer of amount of items that are needed as requirement. usageConditions: Optional string condition in format of to the usage condition of the ExecutableItem. This means, if the condition is =5 then the requirement is that the Executableitem chosen must be on the player inventory as its a requirement but also needs to have usage over or equal a value of 5. Example: ‚≠êrequiredItems Info: This feature allows the activator to have as requirement vanilla item(s). If the player meets this requirement the requirement will be consumed and the activator will run. cancelEventIfError: Boolean value that represents if the event will be cancelled if the player doesn't have the requirement. This means, for example, let's say there is an event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, and it occurs but the player doesn't have the requirements in order to trigger the activator, if this feature is enabled the event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled so the player even though its clicking/hit the entity, the entity is not getting damage because in reality the event is not occurring due its being cancelled. errorMessage: String message that will be sent to the player if the player doesn't meet the requirement. material: Vanilla MATERIAL that is needed as requirement. amount: Integer of amount of items that are needed as requirement. notExecutableItem: Boolean value to make the requirement able to be a ExecutableItem or not. This means, if the requirement is STONE, and this feature is not enabled, then the requirement will meet with vanilla STONE(s) and ExecutableItem(s) with material of STONE and so will be consumed. If you don't want this to happen then enable this feature. Example: ‚≠êrequiredMoney Info: This feature needs the plugin called \"Vault\". This feature allows the activator to have as requirement money from Vault. If the player meets this requirement the requirement will be consumed and the activator will run. cancelEventIfError: Boolean value that represents if the event will be cancelled if the player doesn't have the requirement. This means, for example, let's say there is an event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, and it occurs but the player doesn't have the requirements in order to trigger the activator, if this feature is enabled the event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled so the player even though its clicking/hit the entity, the entity is not getting damage because in reality the event is not occurring due its being cancelled. errorMessage: String message that will be sent to the player if the player doesn't meet the requirement. requiredMoney: Float value that represents the amount of money needed as requirement. Example: ‚≠êrequiredLevel Info: This feature allows the activator to have as requirement vanilla experience levels. If the player meets this requirement the requirement will be consumed and the activator will run. Don't confuse experience levels with experience, more info here https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience cancelEventIfError: Boolean value that represents if the event will be cancelled if the player doesn't have the requirement. This means, for example, let's say there is an event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, and it occurs but the player doesn't have the requirements in order to trigger the activator, if this feature is enabled the event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled so the player even though its clicking/hit the entity, the entity is not getting damage because in reality the event is not occurring due its being cancelled. errorMessage: String message that will be sent to the player if the player doesn't meet the requirement. requiredLevel: Integer value that represents the amount of Minecraft vanilla experience level(s) needed as requirement. Example: ‚≠êrequiredExperience Info: This feature allows the activator to have as requirement minecraft vanilla experiencei. If the player meets this requirement the requirement will be consumed and the activator will run. Don't confuse experience with experience levels, they are different things, more info at https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience cancelEventIfError: Boolean value that represents if the event will be cancelled if the player doesn't have the requirement. This means, for example, let's say there is an event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, and it occurs but the player doesn't have the requirements in order to trigger the activator, if this feature is enabled the event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled so the player even though its clicking/hit the entity, the entity is not getting damage because in reality the event is not occurring due its being cancelled. errorMessage: String message that will be sent to the player if the player doesn't meet the requirement. requiredExperience: Integer value that represents the amount of experience needed as requirement. Example: ‚≠êRequiredMana Info: This feature allows the activator to have as requirement mana from AureliumSkills , MMOCore and AuraSkills . If the player meets this requirement the requirement will be consumed and the activator will run. cancelEventIfError: Boolean value that represents if the event will be cancelled if the player doesn't have the requirement. This means, for example, let's say there is an event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, and it occurs but the player doesn't have the requirements in order to trigger the activator, if this feature is enabled the event of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled so the player even though its clicking/hit the entity, the entity is not getting damage because in reality the event is not occurring due its being cancelled. errorMessage: String message that will be sent to the player if the player doesn't meet the requirement. requiredMana: Integer value that represents the amount of mana needed as requirement. Example: :::info Compatible with AureliumSkills, MMOCore and AuraSkills ::: ‚≠êRequiredMagic (EcoSkills) Info: This feature allows the activator to have as requirement magic from EcoSkills . If the player meets this requirement the requirement will be consumed and the activator will run. cancelEventIfError: Boolean value that represents if the event will be cancelled if the player doesn't have the requirement.

To avoid this you have to add \" execute at %player% run \" before the command, that will force the command to be run from the coordinates where the player is. For example: ‚úÖexecute at %player% run summon tnt ~ ~ ~ ‚ùåplaysound minecraft:ambient.cave master %player% ~ ~ ~ 1 1 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run playsound minecraft:ambient.cave master %player% ~ ~ ~ 1 1 ‚ùåparticle minecraft:flame ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 0 10 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run particle minecraft:flame ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 0 10 ‚úÖeffect give %player% speed 15 1 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run setblock ~ ~ ~ stone ‚úÖexecute at %player% run fill ~1 ~1 ~1 ~-1 ~-1 ~-1 stone replace air ‚úÖexecute at %player% run tellraw %player% \\{\"text\":\"hi\"\\} ‚úÖexecute at %player% run tellraw @a \\{\"text\":\"hi\"\\} These are special exceptions, that means, placeholders or general stuff that only works by certain conditions. Block placeholders If its the case that the activator you are using is related with a block (if don't know what we are talking explore the gui or check the basic tutorial), you can use the block placeholders on commands, such as: Entity placeholders If its the case that the activator is related with an entity (if don't know what we are talking explore the gui or check the basic tutorial), you can use the entity placeholders on commands, such as: Projectile placeholders If its the case that the activator is related with a projectile (if don't know what we are talking explore the gui or check the basic tutorial), you can use the projectile placeholders on commands, such as: :::tip \"Multi-world\" compatibility for the vanilla commands.

Type of server First of all keep in mind that the plugin is a spigot coded plugin, so it needs a server based on it, such as: Spigot Paper Purpur Etc (Any fork of spigot) :::danger For example, Bukkit isn't compatible, it has to be BukkitSpigot. ::: Type of hosting The hosting must allow the owner to import files, if the host doesn't allow that, such as using only the plugins available in a list of the hosting, ExecutableEvents can't be used. :::danger There are Hostings that allows you to install quickly some plugins that are downloaded in their clouds, in the case of ExecutableEvents don't use them, most of them don't work properly, its better to install it with the normal method of importing files. ::: Versions of Minecraft These are the versions supported by ExecutableEvents : Correct way of installing 1. Download the plugin from spigot 2. You get a file .zip (this is like a folder, you have to open it using Winrar) 3. You open it and you see that there are 2 files inside, ExecutableEvents.jar and Score.jar , both of them are needed 4. Pick up both plugins and drag them into plugins folder. (the zip is nothing so don't drag that file into plugins folder, you only need the two plugins inside the jar) :::warning If its the case you are using a webpage host server, it is highly recommended to don't drop it instantly into plugins folder , but, drag them first into desktop and once they are in your desktop, drag them into plugins folder. ::: Once done, you can start your server. :::info It is highly suggested to install it with a reload of the server (stop+start) and not with plugins managers. ::: Special cases If its the case you have ExecutableItems or ExecutableEvents in your server, once downloading one you should update the current one. For example, I want to install ExecutableEvents, while doing, I should update ExecutableBlocks and ExecutableItems too. :::info This is just for keep both plugins in the same versions (otherwise it can bring problems) ::: Still not working In case you got all the information said before, doing the right things and the plugin still not working, feel free to ask in the Discord and we will help you. :::info Also what you can do, that is something that have fixed some problems on people's threads related to the plugin not working, is downloading the plugin again and installing it again. It is weird, it is not our fault, but sometimes just doing the steps again fixes it, nobody knows why, its like a law of life, you could give it a try :P :::",

Permission: If you want to give a specific permission keep reading below, it will be detailed every command with each permission. Commands Here you will learn about commands of ExecutableItems, there will be some words that will be repeaten through the explanation, here they are: SsomarPluginsItem: Its the ID of an ExecutableItem that its created, the same way it can be \"Excalibur\", \"SuperPickaxe\", \"turtle\", \"12345\", we stablished this name. SsomarPluginsPlayer: Its the name of a player, the same way there is \"Vayk\\ \", \"Ssomar\", \"Special70\", \"Tidal\\ Flame\" there is also this name. The format of the commands will have different symbols: \\{\\} : If an argument is surrounded by \\{\\} that means its necessary to run the command. \\ : If an argument is surrounded by \\ that means its optional to run the command. Also there will be different colors (but its the same idea as \\{\\} and \\ ): Blue: Obligatory Orange: Optional General Commands Create a new ExecutableItem Command: /ei create \\{id\\} id: ID of the ExecutableItem. If you want copy the item of another plugin , or a custom vanilla item (Banner, Shield, ...), it's simple Take it in your main hand and execute this create command. Example: Permission: Create a new ExecutableItem from a targeted block Command: /ei create-from\\ block \\{id\\} id: ID of the ExecutableItem. Example: Permission: Open the editor / menu Command: /ei editor or /ei show Permission: or Reload the plugin Command: /ei reload Permission: Reload only 1 item Command: /ei reload \\{id\\} id : ID of the ExecutableItem.

DELAYED\\ COMMANDS: Resets all delayed commands caused by DELAY and DELAYTICK. COOLDOWNS: Resets all player's cooldowns across all items. ACTIONBARS - Resets all player's actionbars from the ACTIONBAR custom command. Example: Permission: Enable / Disable actionbar of ExecutableItems Command: /ei actionbar \\{on or off\\} Example: Permission: Inspect the ExecutableItem that is in your main hand Command: /ei inspect In order to use this command the ExecutableItem must have the feature of store item info enabled. https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/item-configuration/item-features store-item-info Output: Usage Owner UUID Owner name ExecutableItems ID Variables Permission: Remove the owner of the EI that is in your hand Command: /ei unowned In order to un-own an item it must have an owner before, to do that the feature of https://docs.ssomar.com/executableitems/configurations/item-configuration/item-features store-item-info must be enabled on that ExecutableItem After running this command, the next player who interact with this item will be the next owner.

      "content": "Activators features All this features are inside the activator, as reminder the activators allow you to execute custom actions on your ExecutableItem, it can have conditions, run commands, have cooldown, etc. Starred features ‚≠ê are for premium version. General features of an activator Display name of the activator Info: String value of the display name of the activator, it doesn't have much use, its used for the developer to recognize one activator from another. It also appears on the default message \"timeLeft\" inside the locale.yml file. Example: ‚≠êUsage modification of the activator Info: Very important feature, the value of the usage of the item will be modified by this integer value. That means, if this value is positive then usage will increase and if this value is negative then the usage will decrease. Example: (Increasing the value of the usage by 1 each time this activator is triggered) Variables modification Info: Its a list of variables modification to apply to the variables inside your item. Its useful for example, for increase the value of a variable, for overriding an old value of a variable to another value, etc. variableName: Name of the variable the variableModification is targetting type: Type of variableModification you are using SET: Override the old value of the variable and sets the modification value. ADD: Apply math to the current value of the variable using the modification value. It needs the variable to be type of NUMBER. If the modification value is positive then it will increase, if its negative then it will decrease. LIST\\ ADD: Applied to variable type LIST, it appens the modification value to the variable list. LIST\\ CLEAR: Applied to variable type LIST, it clears the variable list. LIST\\ REMOVE: Applied to variable type LIST, it removes the modification value from the variable list. modification: Value of modification. Its applied to the variable using the types of modifications. Example: Be careful when using placeholders here There is no problem with that, just make sure the returning output is a NUMBER, otherwise you will need to use STRING features. For example, let's update a variableModification by another variable that we know it returns a NUMBER. Detailed slots Info: List of integer values that represents slots of the inventory where the activator will be able to work. This means, if the event occurs in one slot that is not from here then the activator won't be triggered. More Info about the slots values. Example: Auto update item Info: This feature of the activator makes that the item is updated in one of the features of the list. Be careful This may not be necessary depending on what you want. There are things that are updated automatically, for example, commands on the activator, conditions, cooldown, etc are updated automatically without this feature. This feature targets most the visual aspects of the item, so if you created once a ExecutableItem with id:ex\\ sword with a display name of \"\\&dExcalibur\" and you distributed this item to all players and now you would like all the ExecutableItems \"ex\\ sword\" to have the new display name of \"\\&eEpic Sword\" then you would need to enable this feature on one of the activators of the item. Enabling the feature (autoUpdateItem) + the feature of update name (updateName). To make sure its correctly explained, this feature will override the current value depending on the options you enabled with the current option of the config file, and its only used for visual features. Its not necessary for common changes that don't involve the options of this feature. autoUpdateItem: Boolean value that represents if this feature is enabled or not for the activator. updateName: Boolean value to update the display name of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current display name of the item with the current/updated item name set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateLore: Boolean value to update the lore of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current lore of the item with the current/updated lore set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateDurability: Boolean value to update the current durability of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current durability of the item with the current/updated durability set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateAttributes: Boolean value to update all the attributes of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current attributes of the item with the current/updated attributes set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateEnchants: Boolean value to update the enchantments of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current enchantments of the item with the current/updated enchantments set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateCustomModelData: Boolean value to update the custom model data value of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current custom model data of the item with the current/updated customModelData value set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateArmorSettings: Boolean value to update the armor settings of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current armor settings of the item with the current/updated armor settings set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. e.g. (Armor color) updateMaterial: Boolean value to update the material of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current material of the item with the current/updated material set on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateHiders: Boolean value to update the hider configuration of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current hiders configuration with the current/updated hiders setup on the config file of the ExecutableItem. updateEquippable: Boolean value to update the hider configuration of the ExecutableItem. If its true, it will override the current equippable component of the item with the current/updated equippable setup on the config file of the ExecutableItem. Example: cancelEvent Info: Boolean value that represents if the event related to the activator is going to be cancelled or not. This can be hard to understand, I think its one of the things that most people don't understand but to explain it you must know that each ACTIVATOR is related to a Minecraft event, following the idea this event occur and then the ACTIVATOR is triggered. if we enabling cancelEvent which is a feature from the activator, that means the event occur, then at almost the same time the activator gets triggered and it cancels the event, so the activator keeps running all its enabled features but the event didn't happen, cancelling it. For example: If the activator is PLAYER\\ HIT\\ PLAYER and we enable cancelEvent then the player won't be able to hit the player due all hits are cancelled/ignored. If the activator is PLAYER\\ BLOCK\\ BREAK and we enable cancelEvent then the player won't be able to break blocks due the event is cancelled/ignored. Example: commands Commands are a list of commands that are run from the console when the activator if it meet all conditions and requirements. You can use vanilla commands here, SCore commands and another plugin commands. All the command lines of this command list are placeholder parsed first with placeholders from Ssomar Plugins and then its parsed through PAPI. Its recommended to check the placeholders list to see what placeholders can you run on each activator. It's available in all activators type since all activators have a player involved. Info: Player commands is a list commands that are normally run against the player when the activator triggers. This means if it has an SCore command, example: DAMAGE 5, the damage will be applied to the user of the ExecutableItem. Custom player commands available from SCore You can also run commands from other plugins or vanilla commands. These commands will be executed by the console. Example: playerConditions Info: You can use this conditions in all type of activators Player conditions worldConditions Info: You can use this conditions in all type of activators World conditions placeholdersConditions Info: You can use this conditions in all type of activators PlaceholdersConditions itemConditions Info: You can use this conditions in all type of activators Item conditions Cooldown Player cooldown Info: Cooldown options its the cooldown applied to the player who triggered this activator for this activator. If the activator is PLAYER\\ RIGHT\\ CLICK, it has some commands \\ and the cooldown is 30 seconds, if the player triggers this activator he will need to wait 30 seconds in order to make it trigger again. This doesn't prevent other player from running it between those 30 seconds as long as that player is not on cooldown too. This is a feature per player cooldown: Integer value that represents the amount of time the cooldown will last for this activator. isCooldownInTicks: Boolean value that sets the cooldown time to be in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) cooldownMsg: String value to be displayed when the player try to trigger the activator when its on cooldown displayCooldownMessage: Boolean value to allow or prevent the message of cooldownMsg displayed if the player try to trigger the activator while he is on cooldown. Placeholders that can be used: %time% - the entire cooldown in seconds %time\\ H% - the hours part of the cooldown %time\\ M% - the minutes part of the cooldown %time\\ S% - the seconds part of the cooldown cancelEventIfInCooldown: Boolean value that cancels the event of the activator if the player is on cooldown. This means, if the activator is PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, while he is on cooldown all the player event's of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled and so they will be ignored, disabling the ability of the player to attack entities (reminder: that activator targets all entities except players) pauseWhenOffline: Boolean value that pauses the cooldown if the player is offline. To better understanding, if its false, the cooldown time doesn't stop so he can leave the server, wait the cooldown and join again and he will be able to trigger the activator again. But if this feature is enabled and he left the server while on cooldown, when he joins again he will have the same remaining cooldown time that he had when he left. pausePlaceholdersConditions: Its similar to pauseWhenOffline but it only pauses depending on certain placeholdersConditions. Example of usages would be pausing the cooldown if the player is VIP rank. So VIP rank has access to that feature. enableVisualCooldown: Enables a visual cooldown for the item. Example: Global cooldown Info: Its the same idea as cooldown but instead of being the cooldown applied to the player its a global cooldown that is applied to all players. That means, if someone triggers the activator and it has 30 seconds of global cooldown, then no one will be able to use it after those 30 seconds has gone. It has the same features as cooldown. cooldown: Integer value that represents the amount of time the cooldown will last for this activator. isCooldownInTicks: Boolean value that sets the cooldown time to be in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) cooldownMsg: String value to be displayed when a player try to trigger this activator when its on cooldown displayCooldownMessage: Boolean value to allow or prevent the message of cooldownMsg displayed if the player try to trigger the activator while he is on cooldown. Placeholders that can be used: %time% - the entire cooldown in seconds %time\\ H% - the hours part of the cooldown %time\\ M% - the minutes part of the cooldown %time\\ S% - the seconds part of the cooldown cancelEventIfInCooldown: Boolean value that cancels the event of the activator if the player is on cooldown. This means, if the activator is PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY, while he is on cooldown all the player event's of PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY will be cancelled and so they will be ignored, disabling the ability of the player to ",

ONLY USE LOWERCASE AND UNDERSCORE CHARACTERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ::: Steps: Step 1: Create folder Create the folder that will contain the texture pack Step 2: Create basic files pack.png - displays the png the texture pack will display in the texture packs menu (Optional) pack.mcmeta - important file that will define what kind of tpack this is \\{% embed url=\"https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack.mcmeta\" %\\} Example: https://htg-george.com/minecraft-pack-mcmeta/?utm source=chatgpt.com We will type 46 in pack format since for this page, we will make a 1.21.4 texture pack. Then finally, create the assets folder. You will put everything there related to custom textures. Step 3: Navigate through the \"assets\" folder Then create a folder named \"minecraft\" or something else since it's just for namespacing. Step 4: Navigate through the namespace folder Now that we are at the minecraft folder, create 3 folders: items, models, textures Step 5: Navigate to the items folder Then for practice, create a file. https://minecraft.wiki/w/Items model definition select For more information on what the \"type\" key does, go to the embedded link above. Inspecting the mace.json file, there's a fallback option to allow mace items to default back to their original model properties. Not all minecraft items possess the same kind of model so you have to do more research on things such as what it would look like if you plan to override inventory model of blocks and etc. Step 6: Go up in the directory and go to the models folder Create a folder named . Why? Scroll up again and check step 5. The model path for \"bat\" is located at \"item/bat\" meaning that the target model file is inside the item folder. You could use a different name for the folder but make sure to sort your files properly. Step 7: Create a json file of your custom texture. Then open the json file in any text editor. Step 8: Modify the json file https://minecraft.wiki/w/Model :::info For this one, layer0 refers to the target png file in the textures folder at the namespace's folder. Do not be confused with the file targets written at the mace.json's fields as it targets the model folder of the namespace folder. ::: For example, we would target the bat.png from the textures folder of the namespace that is inside the folder, For this one, you really need to be careful because when specifying the texture, the parent directory can only either be or or else it will not load properly. Step 9: Add the texture file Go to the textures folder then the items folder and add the png that will represent your custom texture. :::info As of this writing, I have no clue if it works for other file types but to play it safe, use png file types instead. If ever there are cases where the png file fails to provide itself for the custom texture, go to a png converter and reconvert it again as a png file. ::: Step 10: Test it now ingame Run the command: And it should give you the texture that you seek. Conclusion: If you want to use 3d models, refer to Step 8 and use Blockbench software to create 3d textures and save the model output in that file.

      "content": "3D Models First of all, this page needs PRE-KNOWLEDGE related to how to create a texture pack, basic stuff won't be explained here. You can read them in the previous tutorials related to texture pack. Here you will learn how to create the 3d model, and using the methods already explained, merge it with your current texture pack. This tutorial is based on this video \\{% embed url=\"https://youtu.be/4DiwHcW48Qg\" %\\} Application To create the model you have many ways because there are many applications, the one that we are going to use today and I suggest you to use it is Blockbench - https://www.blockbench.net\\ \\ You can either use the webpage online or download the app, anyways, take a look at it and check their controls. Let's create the MODEL First, go to FILE - NEW - JAVA Block/Item Then, this gui will be displayed where the important things are: File Name : Basically the project name, it can be whatever you want The other options aren't necessary unless you already have some experience in this app, so, it won't be explained for now. You can read about them in their wiki though. Once the project is created, you have your work area, and the materials to work with are CUBES. To add a cube press on 1 and to add a folder press on 2. Once a block is added you can move it, resize it or rotate it, each action with specific tools in the toolbar on the top And, you can add as many cubes as you want, move them wherever you want rotate it as you want (actually not, the limit is rotation from numbers related to 22.5, but anyways, that part is done automatically by the app 10/10) and resize it until the max (that is 3 3 3 blocks) With that options, create lot of cubes until you get your final shape of the item you want. In this case mine finished is this one: Let's create the TEXTURE Once the MODEL is done, it looks empty, with no texture, so let's create one First you have to select EVERY cube on your project Then go to the left side and click the button that says \"Create texture\" This GUI will be displayed where the important things are: Name: Name of the texture, it MUST BE LOWERCASE Pixel density: In few words, how detailed the texture will be, imagine like minecraft is 16x16 pixels, and real life is 4096x4096 pixels, real life looks lot of times more detailed than minecraft. (doesn't mean better) And the rest of things just leave it as default or as it shows in the photo, they aren't necessary for now, but, the same as before, if want to know about it just read their wiki. Now the texture is created, so let's go the PAINT zone on Blockbench A new GUI will be displayed, and the same as EDIT zone, you have tools And the colors palette This is your part, where you get picasso vibes and start painting epic things. Once you are done, instead of looking empty like at the first, it will have color and will look as you want. Let's create the DISPLAY Display is basically the way that it will look inside the game, here you edit lot of ways such as: 1. 3D view Right Hand 2. 3D view Left Hand 3. First person view Right Hand 4. First person view Left Hand 5. Item Frame 6. Head 7. Dropped item 8. Inventory To access there just go to the DISPLAY ZONE of Blockbench And just make your edits, the controls are the same as the one from edit Move Scale Rotate Let's get the files necessary to merge them into our texture pack Now we have the model, texture and display ready, the only thing left is get the files to merge them into our texture pack Item file.json Export the model going FILE - EXPORT - Export Block/Item Model Then the APP will ask you where to save it, do it in a safe place, we are going to use it. PNG Texture .png To save the texture just go to the left side and click on the symbol marked in the image. Then the APP will ask you where to save it, do it in a safe place, we are going to use it. Let's merge the files into our texture pack CustomModelData The JSON will be selected from the custom model data line, since my Blockbench model was called Sword.json I will change it to 1.json (just changed the name), in the line of custom model data the path will be the folder path and the name will be 1 (since I changed it to that) :::info \\{ \"parent\": \"minecraft:item/handheld\", \"textures\": \\{ \"layer0\": \"minecraft:item/diamond\\ sword\" \\}, \\} ::: JSON file texture path You have to make sure the JSON downloaded from Blockbench once it is added into your texturepack it is using the correct path of texture, so open it, check the layer0, delete the old path and add the new one. Then save everything and test, everything should work fine :::info If have any question, something doesn't work as intended or have a suggestion don't mind asking it in the support channel ^^ See you ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ :::",

They will have a order, so take care your animation makes sense for you. ( ) In this case they are 16x16, we have to make a texture file where they all are in a row, so it will have 16x(6x16) - 16x96 , then put all them in row in correct order and it will look like this ( ) Files Create your admin json file of the sword, then link it to the sub-admin, and when that sub-admin links the texture, you will have to add a new file, that will have a extension of mcmeta (if it doesn't have it, it won't work) :::info frametime is how much frames it will show you in 20 ticks, in this case, the sword will display 1 frame per 5 ticks, I think that's fine, you can set a faster or lower speed as you want. ::: :::warning The name of the file .mcmeta should be equals as the name of the png texture, so it will look like this ::: ( ) :::info Both files must be together, so if the animatedtexture .png is inside \"customtextures\" folder, the animatedtexture.png .mcmeta must be there too ::: then just save your texture pack and test.

If you don't know how to save specific file types, you can see how its done in the video tutorial. ::: This page will guide you how to add new textures to the game (without modifying the actual ones) from the start making the item, the texture pack, linking everything, until your EI Item has the texture inside the game, so let's begin üòé First of all tell you that all this tutorial is based on the next video: \\{% embed url=\"https://youtu.be/y-t1YMslFLM\" %\\} Here you can learn more deeply about the texture pack, how it works, and if you didn't get at all this tutorial, check the video, its made to understand everything. ü•≥üòà Setting up the item Well, first of all let's create the item we want to have the custom texture, use: I'll set up just some visual things, such as the name and the lore. ( ) Let's create the textures Ok, so the item is ready (you could add activators, mechanics, whatever you want to that item, in this case it will be simple, the main part is the textures.) Now the textures.. they don't appear from nothing, you have to do them.. how? You'll need a photo editor, such as: Photoshop, Paint 3D, Paint.net, Paint, etc. The download part is from your side, so use the one you want, in this case, this will be made using Paint.net The image needs to be: 16x16 pixels (or any power of 2, like 16x16 - 32x32 - 64x64 - etc) PNG Once you have it, we are ready to create the texture pack Texture of the pickaxe (I couldn't zoom more üò´) Now the Texture Pack Well, let's part from the beggining, create a folder, let's call it \"ExecutableItemsTexturePack\" Then add another folder inside it called \"assets\" Besides that folder we also need to add a custom text here, it will be called \"pack.mcmeta\" (it need to be MCMETA type) and will have the next code: :::info The pack\\ format means the version of the Minecraft it will have, 8 means 1.18, 7 means 1.17, 6 - 1.16, and so on. \\ \\ More info - https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pack\\ format ::: So checking what we have, should be this: To don't tell EVERY folder that you have to create I'll leave the format right here, create all the folders. So, in the folder of üìÅcusto& x6D; \\ & x74;extures we will save all the custom textures that we have, in this case, the pickaxe photo we made before. (the file will be - \"pickaxeimage.png\") Now, inside the models/item we have to create one folder and one file.yml for each item, in this case, I will edit the diamond\\ pickaxe, so I will create them The name of \"diamond\\ pickaxe\" is because of that is the nbttag inside the minecraft minecraft:diamond\\ pickaxe :::info The name of the json is the ID ON MINECRAFT It is NOT the name of the item\\ It is NOT the name of the texture\\ It is NOT the name of your minecraft player It is the ID OF THE ITEM INSIDE MINECRAFT. You can see the ID enabling Advanced Item Tooltips (press f3+h) ::: Inside diamond\\ pickaxe.json we will add this code: :::info JUST IN CASE the item doesn't look good in your hand when holding (holding it in a weird way), change instead of \"generated\" - \"handheld\" ::: If you want to do it with another item, just change the file name, then the layer0, and the predicate. And if you want to add more than one custom model data, just add a \",\" and add another line, for example: Where it says \"model\" : \"item/diamond\\ pickaxe/2\" its calling the folder created before \"üìÅdiamond\\ pickaxe\", inside it we will add as many \\ .json as custom model data we set in the file above. In this case I am just setting one custom model data so it will have 1 file called \"1.json\", if they were two custom model data they will be two files called \"1.json\" and \"2.json\" Inside this 1.json we will add this: Where the \"layer0\" part is the folder where is the customTexture, in this case, assets/minecraft/textures/ item/custom\\ textures/\\ (In this case pickaxeimage, remember) :::info PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK THE PATH OF YOUR TEXTURE, MOST OF THE ERRORS ARE BECAUSE PEOPLE SET THE layer0 IN A PATH THAT DOESN'T EXIST, CHECK LITERALLY THE TEXT ABOVE TO KNOW HOW THE PATH WORKS, THIS GOES IN THE TEXTURE FOLDER INSIDE ASSETS . ::: And that would be all, now grab the pack.mcmeta and the assets folder and create a .zip using Winrar :::info If you can't use winrar (as mac users) just create a new folder and drag everything there, that folder will be your \".zip file\", then add it to .minecraft/resourcepacks/\\ and you will be able to use it for local testing. (for server purposes like uploading it, you'd need to check the tutorial about uploading texture pack) ::: ( ) Remember to change it to .ZIP And now let's put it into minecraft (go to resourcepacks and leave it there) Linking the EI with textures Now it is supposed that it is working, so, we are going to edit our item ( ) And in the customModelData config we are going to set it to \"1\" (In the files we set it to 1) ( ) And kaboom üí•üí•, now the item will have the texture we set before ( ) ( ) And that would be all If have any question or feel this tutorial needs to explain something better, just tell us in the Discord of EI ^^ I hope you understood everything, nice day üòÄüòÄ \\========================================== Since a lot of people don't follow the steps correctly, here is the file for you to check if you everything right \\{% file src=\"../../../../.gitbook/assets/ExecutableItemsTexturePackExample.zip\" %\\}",

      "content": "Free vs premium The free version of ExecutableItems is like a free-trial of it, to know how it works, what is possible and you could even make your whole server with it, but once you want to improve your items, and don't have all limitations the free one you have you start thinking into buying the premium version.. but, is it worth? what differences are there? couple of common questions asked in support-ei in discord of Ssomar plugins, this page, should solve your answers. | Free | Premium | | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | | 500 ExecutableItems max | Unlimited ExecutableItems | | 1 activator per ExecutableItem | Unlimited activators per ExecutableItems | | Watermark in the lore of the item | No watermark | | Some activators are not available | Access to all activators | No more limitations Amount of items Tired of creating items and receiving that message of \"hey, you have reached your limit, in the free version you can only have 500 items max..\" ? Well, in the premium version you can create as many items as you want, there is no limit, and also.. as a tip, since you will have a lot of items, wouldn't be a bad idea organizing them in folders. üòé Activators In the free version you can only work with \\~ 14 activators , but there are +40 activators to make your items in the premium version , so you could trigger a block of commands depending on almost every action the player does. Besides you will unlock every activator, you will also unlock the possibility to have as many activators as you want per item , that means creating multi functional tools, that does a lot of abilities, mechanics and complex constructor of skills. All features There are some features that grants a whole different view about how the items, activators, and triggering skills works, ¬øproblem with free one? most of them are disabled in the free version. Premium support You would think.. hey, is there a difference in premium support and free support? generally no. ¬øSo why is this option as a pro of buying the premium version if its the same? well.. once you buy the premium version, a world of features is unlocked, and with that, the possibility to create super complex items, that means that your questions mostly will get difficult to answer, answers that not a lot of people will be able to answer. For example, free version questions are relative easily to answer, since you have limitations, the questions are common and get repeated, so both helpers and even people that peeks the channel and want to help will be able to help you. But with premium stuff.. sometimes the questions that are asked needs a lot of works, opening threads to only speak there, complex mechanics explanations, and that's why the helpers are there, they will be able 99% of times to help you with almost everything, you ask something, and they will figure out how would it be possible, sometimes the way are easier and sometimes harder, but we will guide you to a safe road. Pre-made items Once you got premium, if you haven't spend lot of time using the free one, you will not know how to work with it, so either you learn reading the tutorials in the wiki, the common questions, or taking a look at - pre-made items: In the default items there are a lots of items that needs premium and are cool, looking how they work with free version doesn't make sense, but once you have premium, feel free to open it and see how it works, why it has \"x\" amount of activators, oh, \" this happens.. and then this \".. There is a discord channel and also a webpage where there are also lots of items shared by people, for obvious reasons, most of them are premium, once you got it, the same with the previous one, you will be able to check how they work, or just use them to your server without modifying anything.. as you want And last but not less important, the items made by helpers, sometimes when people ask about items, depending on the complexity / what the asker wants / available time , it is possible for us to instead of explaining how to make the item, we can make the item for you, and obviously, that item will be shared in the premium channel in Discord, that means.. there are more than 3000 files sent in the channel, so, with the WIKI and with the searchbar of Discord, you will be able to search almost anything.. (and obviously, if you don't find it, feel free to ask ^^) Support our work Ssomar, developer of ExecutableItems, have taken a lot of time to develop this plugin bringing you all this time ALL-IN-GUI menu to add every possible feature, Fix all the bugs reported in suggestion-bugs fastest as possible, adding the suggestions that people would like to see in the plugin, and he still doing it until today. Supporters, Special70, Vayk and Ssomar too (unstoppable ), answer every question asked in the supports channels (even if they are already asked in the wiki ü§®ü§® , we link you there), studying the possibilities of the plugin, knowing how it works, spending a lot of time into developing items to get better and better, and with that, get a best experience to answer your questions. Also the answer wait time is crazy, looks like a race üöó, we are always attentive to new messages, so, your message will not leave there alone days until someone answers, you will literally be answered as fast as we can. üí™ Anyways, the fact is that there is a lot of hard work behind, with acquiring the premium version you, and your server, will win in terms of features and also you will support all our hard work behind of it all this time. :::info If have any question related with premium version feel free to ask it in the support channel of Ssomar plugin's Discord. :::",

Type of server First of all keep in mind that the plugin is a spigot coded plugin, so it needs a server based on it, such as: Spigot Paper Purpur Etc (Any fork of spigot) :::danger For example, Bukkit isn't compatible, it has to be BukkitSpigot. ::: Type of hosting The hosting must allow the owner to import files, if the host doesn't allow that, such as using only the plugins available in a list of the hosting, ExecutableItems can't be used. :::danger There are Hostings that allows you to install quickly some plugins that are downloaded in their clouds, in the case of ExecutableItems don't use them, most of them don't work properly, its better to install it with the normal method of importing files. ::: Versions of Minecraft These are the versions supported by ExecutableItems. Free version from 1.12.2 to 1.21.4+ Premium version from 1.8 to 1.21.4+ (More information in MC Versions Compatibility ) :::info In case you are using a version between 1.8 and 1.12.2 you need to have installed NBTAPI. ::: Correct way of installing 1. Download the plugin (Links are available on the page bellow) You get .jar If you only get ExecutableItems.jar, you will need to download also the SCore jar (our lib plugin). You can find it on Modrinth Pick up both plugins jar and drag them into plugins folder. You get a .zip You get a file .zip (this is like a folder, you have to open it using Winrar) You open it and you see that there are 2 files inside, ExecutableItems.jar and Score.jar , both of them are needed Pick up both plugins jar and drag them into plugins folder. (the zip is nothing so don't drag that file into plugins folder, you only need the two plugins inside the jar) :::warning If its the case you are using a webpage host server, it is highly recommended to don't drop it instantly into plugins folder , but, drag them first into desktop and once they are in your desktop, drag them into plugins folder. ::: Once done, you can start your server. :::info It is highly suggested to install it with a reload of the server (stop+start) and not with plugins managers. ::: Special cases If its the case you have ExecutableItems or ExecutableBlocks in your server, once downloading one you should update the current one. For example, I want to install ExecutableItems, while doing, I should update ExecutableBlocks too. :::info This is just for keep both plugins in the same versions (otherwise it can bring problems) ::: Still not working In case you got all the information said before, doing the right things and the plugin still not working, feel free to ask in the Discord and we will help you. :::info Also what you can do, that is something that have fixed some problems on people's threads related to the plugin not working, is downloading the plugin again and installing it again. It is weird, it is not our fault, but sometimes just doing the steps again fixes it, nobody knows why, its like a law of life, you could give it a try :P :::",

The \"2\" part of the math formula above represents the distance from the main location. We will combine it with the \\~ symbols so the user's coordinates will add up along with the math formula. We will be replacing the yaw pitch placeholders with the variables, yaw & pitch. Why are we using item variables?

Do not forget or else you might have to go back to the top (https://imgur.com/EgYwbAq.png) 8) Go back to the main item editor by pressing the back button (https://imgur.com/c0PZVjl.png) (https://imgur.com/IOxGLSP.png) 9) Go to the activator editor (https://imgur.com/dcsImOz.png) 10) Create a new activator (https://imgur.com/Liulvko.png) 11) Create a PLAYER\\ RIGHT\\ CLICK\\ ACTIVATOR (https://imgur.com/U5QgSwz.png) 12) Go to the variables editor of the activator (https://imgur.com/qjuzvez.png) Ok so here's the explanation. First, we will create a variable update which will save our coordinates. Further explanation ahead. 13) Click this icon (https://imgur.com/Wjym249.png) 14) Click this icon to go to the chat editor and type the name of the variable we created at step 4) (https://imgur.com/OPy88ld.png) You see, the default value for this is \"var\" and we are editing a variable under the name of \"x\". Back then in pre 5.0, we get to just click the icon to scroll through the list of variables under this item but now, we have to manually type it. 15) Set the type to \"SET\" (https://imgur.com/OoUQPPK.png) 16) Type \"%x% %y% %z%\" in this icon (https://imgur.com/Ux6L15l.png) In the string update option, the placeholders in it is parsed before it gets displayed or used somewhere else. 17) Press the save button (https://imgur.com/vSAlHjj.png) 18) Go back to the activator editor and save (https://imgur.com/Fa3QsOX.png) 19) Create a 2nd activator (https://imgur.com/Liulvko.png) 20) Create another activator with the same kind (https://imgur.com/U5QgSwz.png) You might be curious, why the heck did we create another right click activator? Because the first activator's task is to save our coordinates via variable update. You might say, \"Can't we just do everything in one activator?\" Nope. Commands run first then the variables. Try doing it in one activator and it will not produce the wanted results. 21) Go to the commands editor (https://imgur.com/B2NzuHH.png) 22) Add the following commands in the chat editor (https://imgur.com/BhJhESg.png) Ok. Here's the explanation. \\ will delay the command for 30 seconds. When it comes to variables, the activator order matters A LOT. Reversing the order of the 2 activators will break the item. As said in the placeholders page, placeholders from the plugin will be parsed immediately meaning that any changes that are bound to happen will not affect the values. With the variable update in step 16, %var\\ x% will transform into the xyz coordinates of where you used the item so after 30 seconds, you will be teleported back to the exact location properly (unless you changed worlds but that's not the goal here.) After typing the commands, of course press the exit button. 23) Save the item and try it out (https://imgur.com/Ib09XI6.png) Save the item and try it out",

This is a guide, \"where to search this\" \"what this means\" won't be answered here, BUT we'll leave everything for you to understand or to go to read what \"x\" means. \\{% embed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab channel=Vayk&v=cGAg5iZCtw8\" %\\} :::info REQUIRES PLACEHOLDERAPI CHECKITEM EXPANSION STRING EXPANSION MATH EXPANSION PLAYER EXPANSION \\ \\ PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EI. ::: Variables Well, let's start, first, world edit works marking 2 blocks, we have to do the same from EI, to do this we will store the coordinate of the blocks in variables. x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 And, since the idea is to use this item as survival, the SET command will only work if the player has enough of \"material\" to achieve the SET command. This means, we need to take how many blocks there are on the selection and how many blocks the player has, to achieve this you can avoid using variables, but I will use them. You can change the method if you want, there are many ways to achieve the same. amountofsetcommand amountofmaterial Activators We have 8 variables, let's create the activators ACTIVATOR RIGHT CLICK This will set the variables (1) to the block selected x1 - %block\\ x\\ int% y1 - %block\\ y\\ int% z1 - %block\\ z\\ int% Now we are storing one block, let's do the same for the another one but with another activator ACTIVATOR LEFT CLICK This will set the variables (2) to the block selected doing the same as before but with x2,y2 and z2. Well We have the blocks saved, now the \"complex\" part, because what we have done is very simple. How to get the amount of blocks needed to run the set command and the amount of material the player has First, the easy one, to get the amount of material we can use checkitem expansion . From there we can take the amount of material the player has in their hand %checkitem\\ amount\\ mat:MMMMMMMMMMMH% MMMMMMMMMMMH is the material, to get the material on the HAND we will use player expansion. Well, one ready, now let's get the amount of materials the player needs to run the SET command. Let's think the player selects a cube, for better understanding I will draw (not the best, just to understand it better) As you can see, the selections are FIRST: 0,0,0 SECOND: 1,2,2 To take the amount of blocks would be decreasing each position by the another one, it would look like this 1-0 = 1 2-0 = 2 2-0 = 2 This will mean the shape has 1 2 2 blocks = 4, but it doesn't have 4, it has 18, what happened here ? Well, as we can see in the first substraction, 1-0 = 1, but it doesn't have 1 of x, the shape has 2 on x, this means there is one \"+1\" missing, let's check the anothers. 2-0 = 2, but on y we have 3, so another +1 is missing, and the same for z, so we have to add +1 to each substraction, something like (1-0)+1 (2-0)+1 (2-0)+1 This will give us that the shape has 2,3,3 , that would mean 2 3 3 = 18, perfect it now returns the correct amount of blocks, BUT, we have a problem, what if the player doesn't select as FIRST 0,0,0 but 1,2,2 , we would have FIRST 1,2,2 SECOND 0,0,0 This means, when taking the value of blocks needed: (0-1)+1 (0-2)+1 (0-2)+1 This return us 0,-1,-1 that doesn't make sense, a shape can't have negative values as size, so, to make BOTH ways to return the same, we need the absolute value of the substraction, it would look like ABS(0-1)+1 ABS(0-2)+1 ABS(0-2)+1 Having as result (1+1),(2+1),(2+1) = 2,3,3 = 2 3 3 = 18, nice we got this, now instead of using the coordinates as 0,0,0 and 1,2,2 we will use the variable coordinates we stored before, and multiply them using Math expansion Now we have the 2 values needed, we have to add them into a variablemodification, so let's create an activator, this will be the one of HOW THE PLAYER WILL TRIGGER THE SET, in this case, RIGHT CLICK+SHIFT ACTIVATOR RIGHT CLICK Here add all variable modifications to amountofmaterial and amountofsetcommand Now, let's build what we want, the SET command As a summarize, the 2 first activators are for storing the coordinates of the block, the 3rd to get the values of howmanyblocksdowehave and howmanyblocksdoweneedtorunthesetcommand ACTIVATOR RIGHT CLICK This activator must be same as the 3rd Now, here we will have the commands, we will use the vanilla fill command execute at %player% run fill x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 material x1 y2 z1 will be replace with %var\\ x1% %var\\ y1% and %var\\ z1% and the same idea with x2,y2 and z2 and material, we will get the material on the hand of the player - %player\\ item\\ in\\ hand% BUT, WE HAVE A PROBLEM that placeholder returns the material in UPPERCASES, so we need it to cast on lowercase using String expansion - %string\\ lowercase\\ \\{player\\ item\\ in\\ hand\\}% And let's clear the material of the player execute run clear %player% %string\\ lowercase\\ \\{player\\ item\\ in\\ hand\\}% %var\\ amountofsetcommand\\ int% (amount to clear) We are ready, BUT, this command can be run always, we have to make the condition that MATERIALWEHAVE MATERIALWENEED Just use the variables we have already stored, called as \"amountofmaterial\" and \"amountofsetcommand\" to do this comparison on a placeholderCondition, PLAYER\\ NUMBER. And we are ready Final words To make the activator only work with certain materials, set the 4th activator a condition of ifPlayerHasItem - detailedSlots: mainhand - and select all your materials, this will work as a WHITELIST If want to restrict the player to don't create shapes that have blocks more than \"x\" just add a placeholderCondition on the 4th activator If you are experienced enough, this item is 4/10 level, this means, you can replicate //walls , //replace , //replacenear and more commands from WorldEdit to be used as players on survival. Hope you understood everything, if have any question feel free to ask, BUT, be careful, again, if you have 0 experience, this may be confusing and we will lead you to a basic tutorial, step by step young padawan",

Item that opens a GUI GUI plugins normally have a place to add a player, for example, the command would be /opengui \\ , so inside your item you have to add /opengui %player% if the command is different just change that, for example /enchanttable %player% If your plugin doesn't have this, instead of adding a place for player, use SUDOOP, for example: SUDOOP opengui SUDOOP enchanttable Stop trident from being thrown Add an activator PLAYER\\ LAUNCH\\ PROJECTILE and cancelEvent on true I would like to disable fall damage for my armor Use the activator PLAYER\\ RECEIVE\\ HIT\\ GLOBAL and specify on detailedDamage FALL, then enable cancel event Disable picking up water with bottle PLAYER\\ RIGHT\\ CLICK and enable cancel event Check if a player is fishing a player Use the activator PROJECTILE\\ HIT\\ PLAYER, PLAYER\\ FISH\\ PLAYER, a LOOP activator and a variable. (Also some activators to prevent bugs) Once the ROD hits the player, PROJECTILE\\ HIT\\ PLAYER will run, so set your variable to \"%target%\" The loop activator will only work if the variable is different than \"NO\", and you can use the variable to target the fished player. And if the player FISH the target, set the variable to \"NO\", so now it resets and stop working Now the activators to prevent bugs are PLAYER\\ DROP\\ THE\\ EI and PLAYER\\ DESELECT\\ THE\\ EI, reset the variable on these OR cancel the event. Summon lightning on cursor First create an activator PLAYER\\ ALL\\ CLICK or PLAYER\\ RIGHT\\ CLICK or PLAYER\\ LEFT\\ CLICK Then in commands use the custom command SPAWNENTITYONCURSOR LIGHTNING 1 By default it doesn't do damage so in addition you can add the custom command DAMAGE {number} How to increase the max life \"x\" each time the activator gets triggered To increase your max life you need PlaceholderAPI and Player expansion, and the command you will use is: execute run attribute %player% minecraft:generic.max\\ health base set %player\\ max\\ health%+2 How to regain health per hit On an activator related to hit such as PLAYER\\ HIT\\ PLAYER and PLAYER\\ HIT\\ ENTITY use REGAIN\\ HEALTH command on playerCommands, check that command on Commands section for more info.

What this does is that when you trigger the left click activator, it will set the variable to 1. This value will be used later. (https://imgur.com/pc6XdsB.png) (https://imgur.com/cMhl3fk.png) (https://imgur.com/QuY7xXK.png) The name of the variable we created is called \"x\" so we need to type \"x\" in here.

Required Items, Required Money, Required ExecutableItems, Sneaking Conditions, etc. If you want to create more than one of those, start again from this step. In this guide, I will follow the example I made. This item will search for a diamond or an executable item. But since orders matter, I will put diamonds as the priority.

To take a look at how math equations work you can use GEOGEBRA To extract the commands from one line or from a function to commands divided you need some pre-knowledge too.

Nutshell Basically, the item will check if a \"specific player\" has a temporary perm on or not. 1) Plan what player will have the permission The player we are going to use must be someone who logged into your server at least once time, or else, running the luckperms command won't work 2) Create the activator will have global cooldown It can be whatever you want, so create it as you like 3) Placeholder condition Go to the conditions editor ( ) Select placeholders conditions ( ) Create a new placeholder ( ) Select the PLAYER\\ STRING type ( ) And let's set the placeholder, first, read this: In the first part you have to create a placeholder like this: %parseother\\ \\{name of the player we assigned in first part\\}\\ \\{luckperms\\ has\\ permission\\ cs.go\\}% What this will do is compare if the player we assigned has that permission For the luckperms part, Its recommended to create a random permission that does nothing, to prevent giving yourself unnecessary problems about perms. For example, in this case we are setting the \"cs.go\" permission, that in our case doesn't make problems. And in the second part we will set no In this way, if the activator can be activated is because the \"player\" doesn't have the perms, so if its \"no\" it will match with the \"no\" of the second part and the activator will trigger. But, if someone has activated it, the \"player\" will have the permission, so when someone try to activate it, the placeholder will say \"yes\" (he has the permission) and will not match with the second part \"no\" so the activator will no activate. 4) Command section Now, with all the commands you use in your activator, you have to add one more, this one: lp user (name of the player selected) permission settemp (permission) true (duration) replace So, let's create an example, if you decided that Player who will have the perms (first step of this tutorial)- Permission we will use - Duration of global cooldown - The command will look like this lp user Special70 permission settemp cs.go true 2d replace :::info And that's all If the guide wasn't clear, there is a mistake or you need help, the helper team can help you in the Discord of Ssomar plugins üòéüòé :::",

As you can see, the for loop shows an increasing value by 0.5 meaning that we're trying to form a line with these distance values. If you want the beam to be longer, add more numbers to the for1 loop Using the math formula from https://docs.ssomar.com/tools-for-all-plugins-score/general-questions-or-guides/math-formulas particle-related-math-formulas, by replacing the distance value with the %for1% placeholder, we can Same will be applied with the .

I made it so it shoots 7 lasers instead of 1 and have a 90 degrees arc (45 to the left and 45 to the right). I also modified the \\{player\\ yaw\\} placeholder to be added along with the %for2% placeholder to compute the supposed yaw value if the player looked at 15 degrees to the right for example Then of course I gave the other commands the appropriate command modification You can always adjust the first loop to customize the size of the arc and the amount of lasers that will be deployed per activation.",

To avoid this you have to add \" execute at %player% run \" before the command, that will force the command to be run from the coordinates where the player is. For example: ‚úÖexecute at %player% run summon tnt ~ ~ ~ ‚ùåplaysound minecraft:ambient.cave master %player% ~ ~ ~ 1 1 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run playsound minecraft:ambient.cave master %player% ~ ~ ~ 1 1 ‚ùåparticle minecraft:flame ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 0 10 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run particle minecraft:flame ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 0 10 ‚úÖeffect give %player% speed 15 1 ‚úÖexecute at %player% run setblock ~ ~ ~ stone ‚úÖexecute at %player% run fill ~1 ~1 ~1 ~-1 ~-1 ~-1 stone replace air ‚úÖexecute at %player% run tellraw %player% \\{\"text\":\"hi\"\\} ‚úÖexecute at %player% run tellraw @a \\{\"text\":\"hi\"\\} These are special exceptions, that means, placeholders or general stuff that only works by certain conditions.

Once it's done you will see the file MyFurniturePack.zip in the \\ \\ textures\\ \\ folder 6. Then two options : 1. If you enabled the feature selfHostPack, you have nothing to do, the pack will be automatically hosted and shared to your players. 2. If you didn't enabled this feature, you have to host your pack 1. You can now host it, for example on https://mc-packs.net/ 2. You can copy the URL of your texture pack (it ends with .zip) 3. Paste it after into the config of MyFurniture 4. Run /mf reload 5.

Download the plugin from spigot 2. Download ExecutableItems and SCore if you don't have them : ExecutableItems Free 3. You get a file .jar 4.

      "content": "‚úîÔ∏è Compatible Plugins :::info Take note that this list is strict related compatible plugins, almost every plugin is compatible with Ssomar plugins, if you want to run a command from another plugin, just replace the name of the target with the placeholders. \\ \\ For example essentials fly\\ essentials:fly %player%\\ \\ For example vanish\\ vanish %player% For example essentials economy economy give %player% 100\\ \\ Etcetera, every command that supports the name of a player is \"compatible\" with EI |EB | EE. ::: This section is for compatible plugins that works with Ssomar plugins, there are some features that we have that its compatible with the other plugins. Before starting you must know that compatible ‚â† usable, allmost all plugins are usable for Ssomar Plugins, this is because all commands are run by the console, that means you can use your custom plugin's commands using the correct arguments. For example Want to apply fly command from essentials to the player ? essentials:fly %player% Want to apply vanish command from essenntials to the player ? vanish %player% Want to give money from essentials economy to the player? economy give %player% 100 And a big list, every command outside Ssomar plugin's world that supports a target where you can fill with %player% then it can be used. MythicMobs You can make your MythicMobs mobs drop Ssomar Plugins Items in these ways: ExecutableItems: 1. Hold the ExecutableItem and do , this will make the item to get imported into the items.yml file of MythicMobs, from there, you can add it to the LootTable of MythicMobs. 2. Executing a skill \\~onDeath from the mob, casting a command skill adding the next line: ExecutableBlocks: The same idea but instead of using ExecutableItem use the ExecutableBlock, and on the command from skill use \"eb\" instead of \"ei\". You can specify the activators from SsomarPlugins to only work with specific MythicMobs using the feature detailedEntities. Example : Creating an ExecutableItem that makes more damage to a list of MythicMobs Example: Creating an ExecutableBlock that damages a specific MythicMob when it walks above the block Example: Creating an ExecutableEvent that only works for a list of MythicMobs. You can summon MM Mobs using this command inside your activator: Depending on the activator you are using you may need to change the placeholders. Example: Instead of %world% it may be needed to use %player\\ world%,%target\\ world% or %block\\ world% ‚≠êYou can use this idea with ExecutableBlocks and LOOP activator to create custom MythicMobs spawner. Run MythicMobs skill from Ssomar Plugins features You can use on commands section to run a skill from MythicMobs. Custom SCore commands CHANGETOMYTHICMOB ‚≠êIts possible to make a fishing system using MythicMobs like the one that is on the Hypixel Minecraft Server. For example having tier list of different fishing rods (All handled by ExecutableItems), that each tier will have from low probability to higher probability to catch more epic mobs from your lakes, adding restrictions to only fish MM mobs from the lakes in \"x\" cordinates (or a WorldGuard region), etc. LevelledMobs ExecutableItems You can make your LevelledMobs drop ExecutableItems using this resource: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lm-items.102081/ AureliumSkills Ssomar Plugins have the activator feature of requiredMana in order to have as requirement for the activator to work. Aurelium Skills commands Also you can use AureliumSkills commands on your plugin, such as giving mana to the player, giving mana to the players around (Like a supporter), etc. ExecutableItems Aurelium Skills NBT You can create an ExecutableItem that while holding it increases your maximum mana, this can be done by creating an item, running the command and then while holding the item running now the ExecutableItem has the NBTTag of the command and so it has the modifications that you made. ExecutableBlocks & ExecutableItems This two plugins (ExecutableBlocks and ExecutableItems) can get linked to each other. This link is made by the EB on the TYPE\\ OF\\ CREATION feature. For example: Placing the ExecutableItem and it becomes the ExecutableBlock linked to it (by default it would lose the data of ExecutableItem and it would be placed as a vanilla block) Breaking an ExecutableBlock and getting the ExecutableItem linked to it. Tracking the same usage that the ExecutableBlock had placed when its broken and turned into the ExecutableItem linked and viceversa. Tracking the same variable values that the ExecutableBlock had placed when its broken and turned into the ExecutableItem linked and viceversa. ItemsAdder ExecutableItems You can use the textures created with ItemsAdder by using customModelData feature or by using item\\ model. You can link the ItemsAdder item into EI by following their wiki on how to link, its by adding the next line of code to the ItemsAdder item file. ExecutableBlocks You can create an ExecutableBlock with the texture of ItemsAdder block, this is done by selecting the TYPE\\ OF\\ CREATION feature of ExecutableBlocks. Its possible to select as detailedBlocks for the activators related to a block of all plugins to select specific ItemsAdder blocks Example: Nexo ExecutableItems You can use the textures from Nexo inside your ExecutableItem just by using the custom model data value or the item\\ model. PlaceholderAPI One of the main pillars when it comes to creating items, you can use any PlaceholderAPI placeholder in any part of our plugins: Lore Commands section Messages (All type of messages, cooldown message, condition not met message, required things message, etc) Variables etc. ShopGui+ This plugin supports selling items with specific NBT Tags on the shop, therefore, it supports ExecutableItems and ExecutableBlocks for being sell. The block command SELL\\ CONTENT is supported for this plugin. ShopKeepers This plugin supports selling items with specific NBT Tags on the shop, therefore, it supports ExecutableItems and ExecutableBlocks for being sell. Tradesplus This plugin supports selling items with specific NBT Tags on the shop, therefore, it supports ExecutableItems and ExecutableBlocks for being sell. WorldGuard For all plugins you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside or outside a region, its called ifInRegion and its compatible with this plugin. All SCore commands are conditioned by WorldGuard protection This means, a BREAK (SCore command) wont run if the player doesnt have permission to break a block at the selected position. Keep in mind that this feature is on SCore commands, not on commands run by our plugins, this means using vanilla command inside one of our plugins \"execute at %player% run setblock %block\\ x% %block\\ y% %block\\ z% air replace\" will bypass any restriction. ExecutableBlocks You can fill a region with specific ExecutableBlock(s) with detailed weights by using /eb wg-fill-region. With this feature for example you could make a globlal loop that resets a specific mine like typical /warp mines inside Minecraft servers. HeadDB ExecutableItems You can use this plugin in order to select a specific player head for the item of the ExecutableItem by using head settings. ExecutableBlocks You can use this plugin in order to select a specific player head for the block of the ExecutableBlock by link an ExecutableItem with head settings and using the TYPE\\ OF\\ CREATION as from the ExecutableItem specified. IridiumSkyblock For all plugins you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their island, its called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisIsland and its compatible with this plugin. SuperiorSkyblock For all plugins you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their island, its called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisIsland and its compatible with this plugin. GriefPrevention For all plugins you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their claim, its called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisClaim and also there is ifPlayerMustBeOnHisClaimOrWilderness and both are compatible with this plugin. Lands For all plugins you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their claim, its called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisClaim and also there is ifPlayerMustBeOnHisClaimOrWilderness and both are compatible with this plugin. ExecutableItems There are some activators specific for this plugin, these are: PLAYER\\ ENTER\\ IN\\ THEIR\\ LAND PLAYER\\ LEAVE\\ THEIR\\ LAND GriefDefender For all plugins, you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their claim. This condition is called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisClaim and is compatible with this plugin. Residence For all plugins, you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their claim. This condition is called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisClaim and is compatible with this plugin. PlotSquared For all plugins, you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their plot. This condition is called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisPlot and is compatible with this plugin. Towny For all plugins, you have the condition to make the activator work only if the player is inside their town. This condition is called ifPlayerMustBeOnHisTown and is compatible with this plugin. Advanced Enchantments ExecutableItems Due the way Advanced Enchantments plugin works, their enchants are not present in the enchantments list. So it can't be added with the enchants feature: ( ) But it's possible to add their enchants on your ExecutableItems by using NBTAPI plugin and following one of this ways: The first way is by creating a vanilla item , then adding the AdvancedEnchantment on it and then while holding it do /ei create \\ , the ExecutableItem output will automatically have the Advanced enchantments imported. The second way is by adding the NBT Tag manually on the ExecutableItems config file. Here is an example: After all this steps you must add manually the enchantment in the lore to let the players know this item has that enchantment. RoseLoots All block commands related (e.g. MINEINCUBE, FARMINCUBE, BREAK, etc) supports the custom block loots from this plugin. MMOInventory ExecutableItems The activators related to enter and leave inventory (e.g. EI\\ ENTER\\ IN\\ THE\\ PLAYER\\ INVENTORY and EI\\ LEAVE\\ THE\\ PLAYER\\ INVENTORY) are triggered by their methods. EnchantsSquared ExecutableItems This plugin supports the enchantments of EnchantsSquared. ExcellentEnchants ExecutableItems This plugin supports the enchantments of ExcellentEnchants MMOCore The requiredMana feature for activators can use mana from MMOCore, allowing you to set mana requirements for activators to function. TAB The custom command SETGLOW is compatible with TAB. You have to use the placeholder %score\\ cmd-glow% BlocksToCommand Plugin that allows you to import structures that can be placed with Ssomar Plugins. Terra Terra's custom biomes are supported by biome conditions using the ifInBiome condition. This allows you to create specific activators, effects, or restrictions based on the biome a player is in. EcoSkills You can use placeholders conditions to check if a player has specific magic values before allowing an activator to trigger. You can use commands to get or remove magic values. ExecutableItems RequiredMagic feature instead of using placeholders conditions and commands to remove magic. FACTIONS UUID SCore commands place and remove blocks safely respecting the FactionsUUID protections of the player. CMI SELL\\ CONTENT command supports CMI prices, allowing seamless integration with the CMI economy system for selling items at the correct in-game value. JOBS REBORN JOBS\\ MONEY\\ BOOST command work for this plugin. AURA SKILLS JOBS\\ MONEY\\ BOOST command works with Jobs Reborn, allowing you to apply money multipliers for players based on their job earnings. VAULT ExecutableItems requiredMoney feature works with Vault, allowing you to set a money requirement for activat",

Example below: 50 = Makes you deal +50% damage -80 = Makes you deal -80% damage : The duration of the custom damage boost Example: (The command below gives you +50% damage dealen for 10s) This command can be used many time and the boost will get stacked, on this example you will see that \\ 0-10 seconds the player will apply 50% more damage then on \\ 10-20 seconds will apply 100% more damage and then on \\ 20-30 seconds of 50% more damage, due that on \\ 10-20 two commands were stacked of DAMAGE\\ BOOST. DAMAGE\\ RESISTANCE Info: Allows you to give yourself custom damage resistance by giving yourself customized damage intake magnifications Command: DAMAGE\\ RESISTANCE \\{modification in percentage example 100\\} \\{timeinticks\\} : Amount of the magnification. Example below: 50 = Makes you take +50% damage\\ -80 = Makes you take -80% damage : The duration of the custom damage resistance Example: (The command below gives you +50% damage taken for 10s) EQUIPMENT\\ VISUAL\\ REPLACE Info: Replaces VISUALLY (there is no risk for losing items) a equipment slot with certain material Command: EQUIPMENT\\ VISUAL\\ REPLACE \\{EquipmentSlot\\} \\{material or EI:\\} \\{amount\\} \\{timeinticks\\} \\{EquipmentSlot\\}: The slot Options: -1 40 36 37 38 39 : The item id of the material you want to replace with or the EI id : The stack amount : How long the disguise is gonna last for Example: EQUIPMENT\\ VISUAL\\ CANCEL Info: Cancel the EQUIPMENT\\ VISUAL\\ REPLACE command Command: EQUIPMENT\\ VISUAL\\ CANCEL \\{EquipementSlot\\} Example: FORCEDROP Info: It forces the player to drop the item that he has in a specific slot.

DELAY Info: Delays a command line for seconds Command: DELAY \\{amount\\} \\{amount\\}: To how long you want commands to be delayed (In seconds) Example: DELAY\\ TICK Info: Delays a command line for game ticks (20 ticks = 1 second) Command: DELAY\\ TICK \\{amount\\} \\{amount\\}: To how long you want commands to be delayed (In ticks) Example: IF :::info CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS IN PLAYER RELATED AND ENTITY RELATED COMMANDS ::: Info: Executes commands if condition is met Command: IF \\{condition\\ without\\ spaces\\} \\{command1\\} &lt;+&gt; \\{command2\\} &lt;+&gt; ... \\{condition\\ without\\ spaces\\}: The condition for the IF to decide whether it runs or not. Symbols: , , , , , It supports () for priority , && for AND and || for OR \\{command1\\},\\{command2\\}: The commands that will be executed Example: WHILE Info: Repeats indefinitely as long as the condition is met. It is also running in async Command: WHILE \\{condition\\ without\\ spaces\\} \\{delay\\ in\\ ticks\\} \\{command1\\} &lt;+&gt; \\{command2\\} &lt;+&gt; ... \\{condition\\ without\\ spaces\\}: The condition for the while loop to decide whether it continues or stops \\{delay\\ in\\ ticks\\}: The delay before the next repetition Delay supports decimals value but they are casted to the next integer (20.1 - 20) \\{command\\},\\{command2\\}: The commands that will be executed in repeat Example: :::info It runs async + Condition support double placeholders, example %player\\ x% %player\\ z% ::: :::info The command will be stopped if the player is offline ::: LOOP LOOP\\ START Info: First part of the command Command: LOOP\\ START loopCount:\\{number\\} : Number of times a command gets repeated. Placeholders are supported LOOP\\ END Info: Last part of the command Command: LOOP\\ END Example: (This is what you will see on config) This is what the ExecutableItems plugin sees when it runs Explanation: When the plugin runs the commands, it duplicates the commands inside the loop commands to reduce the number of command lines in your config to make your config cleaner and since RANDOM\\ RUN gives each command equal rates, the estimated rate will be: 50% chance to get an apple 30% chance to get iron 20% chance to get diamond :::info It supports placeholders ::: FOR - END\\ FOR Command that allows you to target multiple elements inside a list :::info What exactly happened here is that the FOR command will run 3 times because inside the bracket symbols, there are 3 values which are , and . The word will be used as an \"identifier\" for that FOR command so we can use the placeholder for it. So when the effect command runs for the first time, %for1% will return \"\\ Special70\" then \"Ssomar\" for the second and \"Vayk\" for the third time. Don't overthink about the symbol. ::: :::info What exactly happened here is that the FOR loops got stacked so the first FOR command will run the commands in it which is another FOR command that will run 5 times. If you're gonna focus on the SEND\\ MESSAGE command, the reason it ran 15 times because the first FOR command executed what's inside it by 3 while the second FOR command executed the SEND\\ MESSAGE command 5 times which totals 15 times. ::: :::info It works with score variable list placeholders ::: Run commands randomly ? https://youtu.be/jXTDlqoE8dc RANDOM\\ RUN / RANDOM\\ END Info: A command mainly used for RNG. RANDOM\\ RUN Info: The first part of the command Command: RANDOM\\ RUN selectionCount:\\{amount\\} selectionCount: The amount of commands that will be randomly selected inside of the command line. Placeholders are supported RANDOM\\ END Info: The other part of the command Command: RANDOM\\ END :::tip To be able to run multiple commands in one command line inside the RANDOM part use ::: Example: This means that you have a 1/3 chance of getting coal, iron or gold This means that from the 3 give commands, 2 of the randomly chosen command lines will run. This means that there's a 10% chance to give you a diamond block. :::info NOTHING is just a command to adjust y percentage and if you want a case where the RNG will do nothing. ::: :::info It supports placeholders ::: NOTHING Info: Mainly used for RANDOM\\ RUN commands as a \"dummy\" command for RNG adjustments Command: NOTHING \\{amount\\} Example of usage: This command line means that there is a 1/100 chance it will give you a diamond More Examples: 1. I want to make it so 99% chance it will give me dirt and 1% chance to give me diamond BUT I don't want to write 99 lines of the give dirt command. So here is how to do it. The 99 represents that any commands inside the loop command will be duplicated 99 times. You will only see the give command and the loop command but the plugin sees 99 give commands. Here is what the plugin sees (You get the idea.) So let's go back to our main objective. 99% chance to get dirt, 1% chance to get diamond. The RANDOM\\ RUN command evenly gives the same RNG rates to all the commands inside the RANDOM\\ RUN command. :::warning The (5%) percentage stuff is not part of the command. It's written here in the wiki for you to acknowledge the chances for that command to be selected from the list of commands ::: After seeing these RANDOM\\ RUN examples, we will acknowledge that it would work like this. The total of the supposed lines is 100 so it's going to be (100 command lines / 100% = 1%) rate per command. :::info It supports placeholders :::",

      "content": "üîò Custom triggers Custom triggers Custom trigger is a way to store a list of commands and then either run those commands with a simple command or by a schedule system. How to create custom triggers ? Custom trigger is a type of activator, so go to the plugin you want (available in ExecutableItems, ExecutableBlocks and ExecutableEvents) and create the activator and select as option: CUSTOM\\ TRIGGER. Then add on \"commands section\" the commands you want, but be careful Let's explain what happens on each plugin ExecutableItems: To make the items work with this plugin it needs as requirement the player to have the item in the inventory, nice a \"player\" so.. we can run playerCommands against the player such as SEND\\ MESSAGE \\&eHello player with name %player% We can run a player command against the player We can even parse placeholders against the player ExecutableBlocks: To make the blocks work with this plugin it needs as requiremente the block to be placed, so there is no involved a player, that means: We can run blockCommands, since there is a block involved We could (depend if you enable the owner feature) run ownerCommands, who targets the owner of the block. ExecutableEvents: To make the events work with this plugin there is no needed for requirement, that means by just existing it will work, this means There is no player, no block, no owner, nothing involved, so we cant run neither playerCommands nor blockCommands nor entityCommands, etc. Now There is a tip to target this, all custom commands supports adding more than one argument, this means we could store the value of the player who run the command and then run an score run-player-command to achieve this. Its explained here \\ Well, let's continue, since you have already created the activator and the commands, now you can differentiate the CUSTOM\\ TRIGGER into 2 types: Callables: Custom triggers activators which are only callable by the command /\\ custom-trigger \\ Callables and Scheduleds: Custom triggers activators which are callable by commands but also they are scheduled, that means they work in specific certain times. For example: An activator that runs each day at 22:00 hrs. An activator that runs each sunday. An activator that will run the next \\ . - (Optional) Edit the schedule features If you want to trigger your custom trigger using a command it's very easy :::info The trigger ID is equals to the activator ID, you can customize your activator ID by manually editing your config file. ::: :::warning Be sure your activator id is unique , if they are all named activator0 they will be triggered at the same time when one will be triggered. ::: How to run custom triggers manually ? In this category you will learn how to run the custom triggers we have already created Keep in note that values with \\{\\} are obligatory for the command to work, and \\ are optional. For better understanding we also marked as blue = obligatory and orange = optional Before knowing how to make them work, let's talk a bit of how they work. We have created a custom trigger activator with a certain activatorID The commands are basically a \"searcher\" if they find an ExecutableItem with the specified activatorID which is a custom trigger then it will run the activator. What is the idea of doing this ? you would think, why I would refer to a custom trigger inside my ExecutableItem from my ExecutableItem, since I could have write just the commands on my activator instead of calling a custom trigger? Well, the idea is to organize, its useful for complex setup, let's say you repeat 5 command always on 4 activators on your same ExecutableItem then it may (not necessary) be a good idea to pack those 5 commands into 1 activator and just run the custom trigger. The same idea can be extrapolated to other contexts such as using it in ExecutableItems, ExecutableBlocks and ExecutableEvents. Running custom triggers for ExecutableItems Command: /ei run-custom-trigger trigger:\\{activatorID\\} \\ player:\\{playerName\\} \\ slot:\\{slot\\} \\ additionalArguments activatorID: The ID of the activator you created as custom trigger. playerName: The playername of the user If there is no player specified such as then it will try to execute the custom trigger for all the players that have an ExecutableItem with the specified activator ID of custom trigger. If there is a player specified then it will try to execute the custom trigger only for that player and will run if he has an ExecutableItem with the specified activator ID of custom trigger. slot: The slot where this custom trigger should run If there is no slot present then the search is on all inventory If there is a slot specified then the search is only on that slot You can use -1 to target the mainhand slot. additionalArguments: List of words that you can add to your command that you can get later by using %arg0%, %arg1%, ... placeholders. Examples: /ei run-custom-trigger trigger:activator0 /ei run-custom-trigger trigger:activator0 player:SsomarPluginsPlayer /ei run-custom-trigger trigger:activator0 player:SsomarPluginsPlayer slot:-1 /ei run-custom-trigger trigger:activator0 player:SsomarPluginsPlayer slot:-1 how are you %arg0% = how %arg1% = are Running custom triggers for ExecutableBlocks Command: /eb run-custom-trigger trigger:my\\ activator\\ trigger:\\{activatorID\\} \\ block:\\{location\\} \\ additionalArguments activatorID: The ID of the activator you created as custom trigger. location: Location of the ExecutableBlock If no location is provided then it will try to run for all ExecutableBlocks placed, and it will run for the ones who has the custom trigger activator with the ID selected. If a location is provided it will do the same idea but only at that location. additionalArguments: List of words that you can add to your command that you can get later by using %arg0%, %arg1%, ... placeholders. Examples: /eb run-custom-trigger trigger:MyEpicTrigger /eb run-custom-trigger trigger:MyEpicTrigger SsomarPlugins %arg0% = SsomarPlugins /eb run-custom-trigger trigger:MyEpicTrigger block:world,50,65,125 Running custom triggers for ExecutableEvents Info: This trigger is quite different, because on EI we have as condition the player and slot, on EB the location, but on ExecutableEvents we don't have conditions, that means, if you call for this trigger, if it exists it will always run. Command: /ee run-custom-trigger trigger:\\{activatorID\\} \\ additionalArguments activatorID: The ID of the activator you created as custom trigger. additionalArguments: List of words that you can add to your command that you can get later by using %arg0%, %arg1%, ... placeholders. Examples: /ee run-custom-trigger trigger:MyEpicTrigger /ee run-custom-trigger trigger:MyEpicTrigger SsomarPlugins %arg0% = SsomarPlugins Pro tip: How can we run player commands here ? since the event is not linked to a player ?. Well, you can use this feature https://docs.ssomar.com/ player-commands + %arg0% tip. For example Let's say there is an event me as admin I will run, then I would do /ee run-custom-trigger trigger:TriggerOfEvent to make this trigger have player commands we could add the name of yourself there, for example /ee run-custom-trigger trigger:TriggerOfEvent Vayk\\ Now on the commands inside our event we could use /score run-player-command player:%arg0% \\{command\\} For example Command ran: /ee run-custom-trigger trigger:activator0 Vayk\\ Output: All players jump Code: Its important to know that the name of %arg0% which in this case is Vayk\\ is just dummy, it doesn't make anything more than a dummy value to be able to use score run-player-commands to then be able to use player commands. Keep in mind that if you usage a normal SCore Player command it will target %arg0% that's why I used ALL\\ PLAYERS before adding the command. How to run custom triggers scheduled ? We have already explained the basics of how to create a custom trigger, but it may be not very clear how schedule works or how to run them, that's why, since we already know the content, let's check a couple of examples \\ ExecutableEvents Schedule activator with message for your next Event, for example for the new year This activator will run automatically at 1 January 2026 at 00:00:00 and it will run the consoleCommands, so we will start the year with good messages and 10 gifts ^^ \\ ExecutableItem Scheduled activator, such as rewards for having the ExecutableItem in their inentory \"In their inventory\" statement is on the title because remember an ExecutableItem only work if its inside a player inventory With that said let's create an activator inside our item that runs the commands at 10h, 14h and 18h each day, and we give him for having the item some money in game with the command money. Be careful The detailedSlots of this activator is -1, so it will trigger on the hours scheduled but if the player doesn't have it on mainhand it will fail due to conditions, so the player won't receive money. You can adjust the features depending on what you want. \\ ExecutableBlock Custom trigger as reward Here you will see a basic example of an ExecutableBlock with a CUSTOM\\ TRIGGER activator, which when it runs it will drop some rewards at the block location. The idea would be, for example after an event, killing a boss, something epic run the commands: \\ command to display a message to the server about the event then what would happen is o make all the EB placed drop 100 ExecutableItems But how could we do this ? where ? Well let's use what we learn, let's create an ExecutableEvent custom trigger: So basically now we just need to do and thats it, it would send the broadcast message and all EB will run the custom trigger activator (if they have it, I am asumming they have it) which will send a message to the owner about a reward and it will drop the reward, very cool What each player would look, would be like this:",

Basically the rng placeholders are there just to \"make\" you look somewhere since the math formula depends on your yaw pitch values. The reason why there's a -1 in the formula because when the original formula was used, it made particles move in complete opposite of where you're looking at ::: You can also use this very same method to perform directional dashes which FRONTDASH is unable to perform You could use instead of but I'll explain the more detailed stuff. The formula above ONLY gets the displacement between 2 points but CUSTOMDASH1 requires the xyz location because it doesn't have your xyz location as a reference so you have to add your xyz values to the equation to properly launch yourself towards your direction. To increase the speed of the launch, increase the distance value which is the \"2\" value that you can see in the math formula. As to why you have to use the xyz placeholder that gives decimal values instead of non-decimal values, it is to make sure you're landing at the correct location or else you would be flying off somewhere. Player-Direction Offset Formula v2 The above formula only deals with the forward/backward offset but doesn't consider the up/down and left/right offsets. Just replace the ^x ^y ^z with offset values. DO NOT KEEP THE ^ SYMBOL Example Let's say a player is at coordinates , , , facing east ( , ). If you use the command , the player will be teleported as follows: = 90¬∞ (east) = 0¬∞ Using the formulas: Sample Application: ^1 ^2 ^3 Origin-Related Math Formulas Distance from XYZ Example Usage:\\ You want to get the distance between you and a specific XYZ location which is x:30, y:60, z:-120 Example: Using offsets to distance target from location :::info How this works is first, you get the displacement of 2 points. The formula above for example, would use the target block's xyz and the player's xyz values to get the displacement between the 2 points then add it along with the target block's xyz coordinates so you would be able to either pull yourself more towards the location or away from the location. The formula currently has at where it is at. The higher the number in , the greater the displacement value. If you want to distance the user away from that point, use the negative symbol. Otherwise, remove the negative symbol to further pull the player towards the location ::: Example Usage: Threshold Value Math Formula :::info This is an example of a math formula where it deals with the player health placeholder. But if the player health value surpasses the value of 500, it will stop there. ::: The detailed explanation goes like this. in the IF() formula, it first checks if the placeholder would return a number greater than 500. If the placeholder's value is greater than 500, it would get the difference between the placeholder's value and 500 and use that value to subtract from the placeholder's value to prevent it from going above 500. If the placeholder's value is less than 500, nothing happens Oscillating Formula Example Usage: :::info The main function of this method is the Y values Check the part of where the SIN() is at. %for1% represents the increasing number 2 is just part of the formula The 31.4 is the number you have to properly adjust to produce bigger oscillations\\ :::",

How does YML Format Work Exactly In this picture, here is an example of a broken item config. Why? Because YML heavily relies on indention when grouping attributes unlike JSON which relies on brackets. To analyze how it normally works, I will give you simple examples a, c, b belong in the same \"group\" because they belong in the same line spacing You can see that line 4 starts with 2 more spaces than line 3. Which means that the next following lines, line 5 and line 6, belong to the \"group\" which is line 4 I can add more things below line 6 and they will still be a part of \"x\" How do I know which belongs to a group? VSCode would tell you where it is. As you can see, since line 8 9 10 has 2 more spacing than \"mococo\", those 3 lines now belong to \"mococo\" For proof, I closed it and it placed line 8 9 10 inside it. but why not line 11? Line 11 had 2 less spaces than line 10, meaning that the members of line 7 starts from line 8 and ends at line 10 Going back to a random ei item: based on spacing, anything inside of the red line is part of activator1 \"activator2\" had less spacing than the child elements of \"activator1\" which allows the plugin to know that \"ok, activator1 properties stop at variablesModification: \\{\\}\" and now we start reading the properties of \"activator2\" but then, \"activator3\" had an unusual spacing count. instead of the \"per 2 spaces\" part, that one had 1 spaces, making the plugin confused, causing the plugin to make a duplicate of the item config in the items folder. how to fix? just check the spacing of the previous activators. if you need more example where a TON of activators are involved, visit ssomar.com for some item configs. Some may ask, \"this follows the spacing rule. but why does it not work?\" In ei's activator format, stuff such as \"activator0:\" \"activator1:\" must belong to the group of \"activators:\" But for this picture, \"activator3\" technically belongs to \"config\\ update:\" but for the plugin, it's not supposed to be that way Which means, you have to move \"activator3\" to be at the same group as \"activators:\".",

Initial Player Placeholders The significance of these placeholders is for people who want to create advanced configurations that require the user's values when the activator gets triggered while expecting them to not change as the commands execute. Target player placeholders (The activator must have a target player) Its the same placeholders that the PLAYER PLACEHOLDERS abov& x65; , just replace \"player\" by \"target\".

Example: Block placeholders (The activator must have a block) in EI / EB it's always these placeholders for entity. in EE it's quite different, since we can have a block as a main actor of the event but also as target. So use these placeholders below when the block is the main actor of the event. And Look the part Target block placeholders when the block is the target. | Placeholder | Description | %block% | Type of the block when the activator has been activated (In caps) | %block lower% | Type of the block when the activator has been activated (In lower case) | %block live% | Current type of the block (In caps) | %block item material% | Return the item material of the block for example the block CARROTS return CARROT, for lower cases use %block item material lower% | %block live lower% | Current type of the block (In lower case) | %block x% | X-Coordinates of the block (USE %block x int% to get the block coordinates without decimals) | %block y% | Y-Coordinates of the block (USE %block y int% to get the block coordinates without decimals) | %block z% | Z-Coordinates of the block (USE %block z int% to get the block coordinates without decimals) | %blockface% | Returns the face of the selected block. | %block data% | Returns the data of the block | %block world% | The name of the world where the block is located ( %block world lower% for lower) Use & x3C;& x3C;%block world% when entering world argument in vanilla commands | %block biome% | The name of the biome where the block is located List of all biomes here ( %block biome lower% for lower) | %block dimension% | The type of world (nether, custom, normal, end) | %block spawnertype% | Returns the type of mob in spawner or \"null\" | %block is ageable% | Returns if the block is ageable or not | %block eb id% | If the block is an ExecutableBlock then it returns its ID otherwise it return an empty text. Target block placeholders (The activator must have a target block) Its the same placeholders that the BLOCK PLACEHOLDERS abov& x65; , just replace \"block\" by \"target\\ block\". Example: Projectile placeholders (The activator must have a projectile) | Placeholder | Description | %projectile x% | X-Coordinates of the projectile (Decimal) ( %projectile x int% for no decimals) | %projectile y% | Y-Coordinates of the projectile (Decimal) ( %projectile y int% for no decimals) | %projectile z% | Z-Coordinates of the projectile (Decimal) ( %projectile z int% for no decimals) | %projectile% | The type of projectile but at all caps | %projectile lower case% | The type of projectile but at all lowercase | %projectile name% | Name of the projectile (More specifically, it will display what's written in your custom projectile's option) | %projectile name lower case% | Name of the projectile but at all lowercase (More specifically, it will display what's written in your custom projectile's option) | %projectile uuid% | UUID of the projectile (%projectile uuid array% for its 4-array integer form. Ex: | %projectile world% | World name of the projectile ( %projectile world lower% for lower) Use & x3C;& x3C;%projectile world% when entering world argument in vanilla commands | %bow force% | If the projectile has been launched with a bow, you can use this placeholder to obtain the force that the player used to shot his projectile. (Between 0 and 1) Owner Placeholders (Will work only if an owner is set for the block / item) Its the same placeholders that the PLAYER PLACEHOLDERS abov& x65; , just replace \"player\" by \"owner\". Example: Variables placeholders Here you can take a look at the internal item/block variable types and their placeholders. This type of variables are not the same as \"score variables\", these variables are independent for each item/block, and score variables are variables not linked to an item or a block. Variable Placeholders - Internal item/block (Placeholders that you can use if you have a variable) Example if your variable is named: X | Placeholder | Description | | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | | %var\\ X% | Value of the variable X | | %var\\ X\\ int% | Value of the variable X cast in an Integer | | %var\\ X\\ roman% | Value of the variable X in roman numbers | List Variable Placeholders - Internal item/block | Placeholder | Description | Usage | | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

How to display the particles The command to display the particle is You will have to select a shape and configure correctly the command to achieve to do what you want. How to remove displayed particles The command to clear displayed particles is General settings for all shapes Define the spawn point To define where the shape will be displayed you have two choice, by mentioning directly the location or setting an entity UUID Using Player/Entity UUID When you decide to use the entity UUID the shape will follow en Player/Entity if he moves . So it can deform the shape or make a cool effect. :::danger You have to specify an UUID of a player or an entity. The player name doesn't work ::: Using a specific location Using location you are sure that the shape will not be deformed, it will stay static. Particles definition Particle type Define the particle used by the shape. By default it will be the FLAME particle List of particles available here: List of Spigot particles Color Instead of using if you want to use REDSTONE / DUST particles you can directly use the setting color with a custom color. You can set two colors separated by a , to have a color transition. Block particles Instead of using if you want to use BLOCK\\ CRACK / BLOCK particles you can directly use the setting blockdata with a material. Item particles Instead of using if you want to use ITEM\\ CRACK/ ITEM particles you can directly use the setting itemstack with a material. Offset / Shift the spawn point of the shape You can define an offset in a specific direction, it allows you for example to display the shape around the player / entity, without having to do complex calculation. offsetPitch: the pitch direction where the offset will be directed offsetYaw: the yaw direction where the offset will be directed offsetSitance: the distance of the offset offsetX: Increase the offset X location offsetY: Increase the offset Y location offsetZ: Increase the offset Z location By default these settings are set to 0 Settings of the shapes Atom Creates a set of elliptical orbits with a small particle sphere at the center, resembling an atom. : Number of elliptical orbits. : Radius of the orbits in blocks : Number of particles per orbit.
